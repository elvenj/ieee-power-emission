"Performance-Aware Interconnect Delay Insertion Against EM Side-Channel Attacks","M. Jiang; V. F. Pavlidis","Department of Computer Science, Advanced Processor Technologies group, University of Manchester; Department of Computer Science, Advanced Processor Technologies group, University of Manchester","2021 ACM/IEEE International Workshop on System Level Interconnect Prediction (SLIP)","11 Jan 2022","2021","","","25","32","Random Delay Insertion (RDI) has been shown to be an effective countermeasure to side-channel attacks (SCAs) on on-chip power networks. RDI effectively reduces the correlation between the power dissipation and the processed data. However, random delay insertion can degrade circuit performance. Considering the theoretical benefits of delay insertion, this paper proposes a novel methodology that adds delay to interconnect buses to mitigate electromagnetic (EM) SCAs without degrading bus latency. The methodology comprises an efficient delay insertion scheme that hinders electromagnetic attacks, where the delay is inserted into the boundary lines of the bus. As the worst-case bus latency is determined by the lines that drive the maximum cross-coupling capacitance, inserting delay at the boundary lines does not affect the circuit performance as these lines always drive a lower capacitance. The inserted delay improves the security strength of the bus to EM attacks due to the reduction of the correlation between EM emissions and transmitted data, making the methodology effective and directly applicable with negligible overhead. The technique is applied to interposer based off-chip memory buses due to the increasing adoption of 2.5-D integrated systems (although the method is effectively applicable to any interconnect bus). Simulation results show that the technique decreases SNR below 1, which makes EM attacks unsuccessful, and does not increase the (worst-case) bus latency, sustaining the overall circuit performance. Consequently, the proposed method provides a superior EM SCA mitigation method compared to the state-of-the-art. Indeed, theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the new technique can offer the same level of protection against SCAs with better performance than other hardware RDI countermeasures.","","978-1-6654-0083-1","10.1109/SLIP52707.2021.00013","European Commission(grant numbers:754337); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9667857","interconnection;delay insertion;crosstalk;coupling capacitance;electromagnetic emission;side-channel attack","Correlation;Circuit optimization;Simulation;Integrated circuit interconnections;Side-channel attacks;Capacitance;Delays","","1","","24","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A carbon recycling model is proposed to exploit the operational flexibility of multi-energy synergies to enhance economic profits of MES operators under market incentives. Then, a generalized cost model incorporating the lifetime cost of carbon capture and power-to-gas degradation is formulated to provide a quantitative analysis for the coordinated electricity and carbon trading. The co-movements of price fluctuations in electricity and carbon markets are explored through a tailored explainable neural network and uncertainty couplings in the markets are further revealed by a Clayton copula based joint probability distribution (PD) model of price prediction residuals. Moreover, a distributionally robust optimization method is formulated for the optimal coordinated operation of MESs to cope with uncertainties from interrelated fluctuating prices. Numerical studies corroborate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology in the enhancement of economic and environmental benefits.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2024.3355132","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52277091); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10401993","Carbon market;energy internet;machine learning;renewable energy;uncertainty couplings","Carbon;Carbon dioxide;Uncertainty;Recycling;Couplings;Costs;Combustion","","","","","IEEE","17 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The first develops methodologies to quantify the multiple benefits of transmission and applies these methodologies in two sample transmission projects. Using 40 years of weather data, a methodology is developed to examine resilience to extreme weather events. Extensive sensitivity analysis is conducted across renewable energy and fossil-fuelled generator levels, gas prices, and load growth rates, to examine risk mitigation. Loss-of-load expectation analysis is used to examine resource adequacy benefits. Adjusted production cost, emissions, and enablement of high-quality renewable resources are also quantified. These methodologies are applied to two types of example transmission projects in ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) to demonstrate a value-stacking approach. The second investigates cost savings for new generator interconnections through a proactive planned approach. A proactive planned approach can study larger numbers of projects or even look forward to anticipate projects due to public policies and may be able to right-size transmission facilities for the longer term rather than sequentially building many small facilities. In this analysis, we compare generator interconnection costs across three different levels of proactiveness in MISO (Midcontinent ISO) and SPP (Southwest Power Pool) to understand the importance of a proactive, planned approach for generator interconnection.","","978-1-83953-833-9","10.1049/icp.2022.2728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10117536","","","","","","","","5 May 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"
