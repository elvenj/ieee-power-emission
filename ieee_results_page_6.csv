This paper proposes an algorithm to mitigate the harmonic distortion at the point of connection (PoC) of a wind power plant (WPP). Instead of opting to conventional method using passive filters to mitigate harmonics, this method only upgrades the control functions of the existing control systems of a WPP without additional investment. The mitigation algorithm performs the measurements at the PoC for a time window, which is transformed and analysed in frequency-domain. Then, it calculates the required harmonic current injections for selected wind turbine(s) to cancel the harmonics at PoC based on the frequency-dependent nodal analysis. To validate the algorithm, a generic WPP layout with multiple strings and field measurements of harmonic emission provided by Vestas Wind System A/S is used to simulate the harmonic propagation in the WPP using the MATLAB/Simulink along with PLECS Toolbox.","1944-9933","978-1-7281-5508-1","10.1109/PESGM41954.2020.9281458","Vestas; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9281458","Frequency-domain analysis;harmonic mitigation;nodal analysis","Frequency-domain analysis;Current measurement;Power quality;Wind power generation;Harmonic analysis;Wind turbines;Power harmonic filters","","3","","15","IEEE","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The implementation of emissions reduction in this sector, especially in the road transport, is a significant endeavor that can help to prevent increasing the average global surface temperature. However, the questions are how mitigation measures or mitigation policies are appropriate for reducing GHG emissions in the road passenger transport. Therefore, this study aims at formulating decarbonization pathway scenarios of Thailand's road transport. The studied period for GHG mitigation is 2015–2050. This study assesses the potential of GHG mitigation by the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in Thailand's NDCs and identifies advance technologies and fuel substitution in the road transport sector in order to achieve the 1.5-degree global climate target. The Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Enduse (AIM/Enduse) is selected for the analysis. The AIM/Enduse is developed by National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan. It is employed to investigate the decarbonization pathways achieving 1.5-degree target during 2015–2050, extended from the Thailand's updated NDC2020. In addition to the BAU scenario, three GHG countermeasure scenarios are formulated for the transport sector in Thailand, namely the extended NDC 2050 (EX_NDC2050), full battery electric vehicle implementation (BEV) and full bio-fuels implementation (BIOF). Results suggests that the emission pathway in the EX_NDC2050 scenario will be higher than the 2-degree target in 2050. The Thailand's updated NDC 2020 in the transport sector are not in-line with the 2-degree and 1.5-degree targets. The emissions pathway of the transport sector will be in-line with the 2 -degree target when the battery electric vehicles (BEV) and bio-fuels are fully implemented. The 2-degree target can be achieved when the combined measures in the transport sector are implemented in the proportion of BEV to bio-fuels of 75:25 or 25: 75 vice versa. Finally, the policy implication on energy efficiency and CO2 emissions suggests that Thailand should increase the share of electric vehicles and the use of bio-fuels. Moreover, the government should encourage green electricity generation from cleaner technologies and renewable energy including transportation demand management.","","979-8-3503-3326-8","10.1109/ICUE55325.2022.10113536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113536","AIM/EndUse;Decarbonized Transport Sector;Electric Vehicles and Bio-fuels;Paris Agreement;Thailand","Temperature measurement;Renewable energy sources;Road traffic;Green products;Transportation;Low-carbon economy;Electric vehicles;Climate change;Biofuels","","","","39","IEEE","4 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, an improved H-bridge multilevel inverter (IHBMLI)-based PV power conversion system (PPCS) is proposed which integrates solar PV array with the existing distribution network. The five-level output voltage reduces the total harmonic distortion and the low switching frequency reduces overall losses. In addition to the real power injection, the proposed PPCS enhances the grid power quality in the distribution system. A single-input–multiple-output single-ended primary inductance converter is designed to track the maximum power from the solar PV array and realizes isolated dc sources for the MLI. The performance of the IHBMLI-based PPCS is verified using extensive simulation studies in the MATLAB/Simulink.

The IEEE PES Task Force on Harmonic Modeling and Simulation developed a Benchmark Test System to support this line of research. Therefore, this article uses the IEEE PES Benchmark to evaluate and compare harmonic contribution determination (HCD) methods. To do so, this Benchmark Test System was implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and used to test five HCD methods proposed in the literature under different network operating cases, including cases with background distortions and resonance. The methods are the Voltage Harmonic Vector Method, the IEC Method, the Dominant Impedance Method, the Capacitor Switching Method, and the Harmonic Current Injection Method. It has been found that the HCD methods generally led to similar contribution percentages, proving the convergence of the methodologies.

Their location in the network and their capacity is generally based on optimization studies to minimize power losses and congestion, while balancing line loading and node voltages. The quantification of this impact in technical and economic terms may help define a tariff, or structure a payment scheme for DER owners, and an incentive to participate in the energy mix in systems where markets are absent, e.g. enabling third-party integration in mini-grids, or vertically integrated utilities. In addition, virtual power plants (VPP) can aggregate and coordinate these DERs to provide a single power profile as an aggregation service in return for a payment through an adjusted tariff structure. This study discusses a methodology to quantify the techno- economic benefit to the system, in an attempt to explore potential opportunities for VPP implementation. A modified, intentionally congested, IEEE 30 bus network is used, with solar PV and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), to quantify the impact of aggregated DER coordination in terms of power losses and congestion mitigation. The network management services market for the VPP considers two use cases: the offset of fuel- based generation and the replacement of ’Peaker’ plants. A high-level approach for assigning an economic value to these technical benefits is also discussed, considering the impact of the size of the VPP and its share in the energy mix.","","978-1-6654-2052-5","10.1109/ICGEA54406.2022.9792025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9792025","Network management;virtual power plant;mini-grid;flexibility;renewable energy","Economics;Renewable energy sources;Loading;Tariffs;Virtual power plants;Power systems;Planning","","","","10","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Assuming a relatively high FC and relatively low FOR favors renewables (i.e., Optimistic-RE), while the opposite disfavors them (i.e., Pessimistic-RE). Compared with optimistic RE assumptions, the pessimistic RE assumptions result in significant increases reaching up to 11%, 17%, and 41% in costs, emissions, and battery storage deployment, respectively.

Optimizing the power grid transfer capacity is crucial for maintaining grid stability and reliability. Ageing infrastructure, population growth, and revolutionary technological developments increase the demand for grid modernization and resilience investments. Climate change and natural disasters highlight the need for adaptive load-shedding schemes. The two possible ways to optimize the grid are an ampacity increase or a voltage increase. While increasing voltage provides the most significant rise in rating, it comes with high investment costs. Out of all the options available, dynamic line rating (DLR) is the most efficient and cost-effective solution. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the optimization of the grid transfer capacity using DLR. The review critically examines different line rating methods, the DLR system, factors that need to be considered before DLR implementation, and its advantages and disadvantages. Also, the review presents the real-world applications and case studies, standards and regulations involved, and current approaches and challenges for implementing DLR in Malaysia. Additionally, we highlight the most commonly used standards to calculate the conductor’s ampacity for the steady-state and dynamic state. Moreover, this review work presents how DLR can advance the grid’s flexibility, considering its significance for cleaner energy production in the future, challenges related to wind energy power generation, and their mitigations.

The goal of universal electricity access and the climate change mitigation paves the way for many public/private owned microgrids in remote areas. Having in mind various uncertainties associated with the design parameters of the MG (e.g., temperature, irradiation, load), this paper presents a probabilistic approach for optimal sizing and techno-economic assessment of the PV-based MG. The potential environmental impact of the isolated MG is taken into account by considering both, the PV/Battery, and more conventional PV/Battery/Diesel Generator configuration. The effectiveness of multi-year data over the single year data in the probabilistic approach is demonstrated. The probabilistic techno-economic analysis of different configurations facilitates informed decision making regarding the configuration and size of MG components while meeting the reliability of supply and environmental constraints. The feasibility and affordability of the configurations are demonstrated through the distribution of net present cost, levelized cost of energy and the unmet load percentage.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2022.3216386","EPSRC-India(grant numbers:EP/P003605/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9926083","Microgrids;battery;photovoltaic system;economic analysis;optimal sizing;rural electrification;probabilistic approach","Costs;Batteries;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty;Power system reliability;Microgrids;Power system economics;Climate change;Photovoltaic systems;Rural areas;Load modeling","","1","","44","IEEE","21 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the anti-symmetry property that a non-redundant signal and its symmetric signal is equal to zero with the same absolute value, a non-redundant signal is used to reduce the large amplitude of the ACO-OFDM signal and enhance its symmetric ACO-OFDM signal that is clipped to zero due to negative signal clipping, allowing LED nonlinearity mitigation. The proposed scheme is also energy-efficient, as the large-amplitude signal reduction is equal to the symmetric signal enhancement, requiring no extra power. However, the designed non-redundant signals fall on odd subcarriers and interfere with source signals. The even subcarriers include the absolute value of source signals, which can be utilized to recover source signals. The polarity of source signals on even subcarriers can be determined by ensuring that the remaining part is higher than the clipping part of the large-amplitude signal in the process of LED nonlinearity mitigation. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms a number of state-of-the-art methods in the literature as well as ACO-OFDM systems with no LED nonlinearity mitigation in terms of bit error rate (BER).","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2020.3034822","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901138,61801145); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018A030313298,2018A030313344); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20180306171800589,KQTD20190929172545139); Guangdong Science and Technology Planning Project(grant numbers:2018B030322004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9244127","ACO-OFDM;nonlinearity mitigation","Light emitting diodes;Time-domain analysis;OFDM;Adaptive optics;Bit error rate;Stimulated emission;Frequency-domain analysis","","5","","11","IEEE","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Policies that promote renewable energy and the electricity market design influence energy transition at a countrywide level. Policy instruments include feed-in tariffs (FITs) and renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) that have been adopted worldwide. FITs and RPSs function by guaranteeing a fixed price and setting a minimum amount of renewable energy. In addition to policies, the electricity market affects the promotion of renewable energy, with which electricity markets are classified into regulated and deregulated markets. Compared to a regulated market, a deregulated market is more likely to provoke competition between suppliers, which is propitious for developing renewable energy. This article covers the following topics: (1) the effects of government policies on energy transition; (2) how different types of electricity markets work and their potential to promote the use of green electricity; and (3) a case study of an electricity market, in which policy instruments were used to encourage green electricity, and efforts paid by the government and citizens towards an energy generation profile of less emission and more renewable electricity.","","978-1-6654-8663-7","10.1109/GECOST55694.2022.10010446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10010446","Feed-in tariff;renewable portfolio standard;electricity market;renewable energy;energy transition","Renewable energy sources;Power supplies;Instruments;Green products;Tariffs;Production;Electricity supply industry","","","","13","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The high cost and unreasonable optimization are the important reasons for its rapid development. A new energy economic benefit model is put forward, and its environmental and economic benefits are analyzed. By comparing and analyzing the photovoltaic power generation in the new energy, the economic index of the new energy power generation is optimized, so as to achieve the best optimization scheme.

Specifically, the common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) currents and voltages are measured, and their frequency-domain behavior is studied. It is suggested that conducted emissions from PV can be classified into three zones: 1) extremely low-frequency (ELF) zone, 2) power frequency zone, and 3) switching frequency zone. Important observations from this exercise are the measurement of harmonic contents of current with total rated current distortion (TRD), imbalance in the output voltage, and low-frequency ripples in the dc voltage. Frequency-domain behavior of the CM quantities is studied which throws light on important points like a relation between input and output CM quantities and a relation between CM voltage and CM current.","2637-6423","","10.1109/LEMCPA.2024.3359485","Swedish Energy Agency through the Project “PV Related Disturbance and Safety Issues: Analysis of Risks and Mitigation Measures”(grant numbers:51005-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10416156","Common-mode (CM) currents;conducted emissions;harmonics;solar photovoltaic (PV);voltage imbalance","Inverters;Current measurement;Voltage measurement;Switching frequency;Frequency measurement;Harmonic analysis;Electromagnetic compatibility","","","","20","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because the participation needs to be voluntary and contributors true utility will remain unmonitored, proper communication among the participants is essential. In the discussed common-pool resource (CPR) problem, all the members need not be contributors, but the non-excludable component of the resource is required to be multiplied with each of the member's rivalrous component, and all these products are needed to be summed up to calculate the overall resource requirement. This characteristic applies to a typical power system optimization problem, where, if a customer group installs a common dynamic voltage restorer, voltage improvement can be treated as non-excludable quantity, while the peak load of individual customers can be treated as rivalrous quantity. In this work, we consider, the participants sharing the CPR contribute to form an open system to capitalize on `economy of scale', while discouraging the unilateral free-riding benefit. Considering the benefit and average production cost curve represented by piecewise linear functions we have shown that the utility function is convex. Furthermore, for the given problem, we have numerically calculated the utility distribution scheme by solving an optimization problem.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2901389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8651365","Common pool resources;voltage sag mitigation;carbon capture and storage;game theory;convexity;optimization","Games;Resource management;Two dimensional displays;Open systems;Production;Power quality;Optimization","","5","","42","IEEE","24 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
