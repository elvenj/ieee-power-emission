Radial basis function (RBF) interpolation, known as an excellent function approximation method, is investigated to implement the nonlinearity mitigations. To further remove the memory effect of LED, which could not be ignored, we propose to extend RBF to a high-dimensional interpolation so that it can eliminate both nonlinearity and memory effect simultaneously. The performance of the proposed RBF extension interpolation is verified by numerical simulations, and a better performance in suppressing nonlinearity is obtained in VLC-OFDM systems as compared with the frequency domain nonlinear compensation method.

Thus, the reduction of EMI emission in the DC-DC converter is the need of the hour for the efficient functioning of the converter. An interleaved boost converter (IBC) is a preferable DC-DC converter for the high efficient application since they have low input current ripple, quicker transient response, and improved reliability. Hence, in this article authors proposed an effective EMI mitigation method by employing a chaotic pulse width modulation (PWM) switching technique for the enhanced performance of IBC. The proposed technique has been verified by developing a suitable FPGA algorithm for generating the chaotic PWM pulses and interfaced with a prototype of a DC-DC interleaved boost converter. The results obtained from the prototype are presented and discussed in the results section. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis shows the effective suppression of conducted EMI using chaotic PWM switching than classical periodic PWM switching.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of the three types of neural networks: deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short term memory (LSTM) neural networks for the compensation of the SOA-induced nonlinearity. We first compare the fitting ability of the three neural networks on the saturated response of SOA.

This study conducts an LCA of a BEV battery pack considering the influences of the charging electricity mix and repurposing the used battery. A cradle-to-grave system is considered to assess the environmental impacts of a Lithium-ion battery (LIB) weighing 290 kg and a pack energy density of 188.3 Wh/kg. The LIB cells were repurposed at their first end-of-life, considering a 50% cell conversion rate (CCR) for 5 years second-life. LCA results show a 6% reduction in GWP impact when the share of renewable sources in the charging electricity mix is considered. Considering recycling, an 11% reduction in GWP is found and less than 1% reduction for repurposing the used LIB cells. The sensitivity analysis found marginal benefits for a longer second-life and higher CCR values (>50%). The parameter with the most influence in the results is the source of electricity to charge the repurposed LIB. Thus, the potential benefits of second-life batteries strongly depend on the source of charging electricity followed by a longer second lifetime (>5 years).","1938-8756","978-1-6654-0528-7","10.1109/VPPC53923.2021.9699168","European Union's Horizon 2020 Program(grant numbers:824256); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9699168","Life cycle assessment (LCA);second-life batteries;electric vehicles;li-ion battery","Lithium-ion batteries;Electric potential;Renewable energy sources;Sensitivity analysis;Production;Propulsion;Electric vehicles","","2","","26","IEEE","10 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The mass-market retail sector plays an important role in this context. Notwithstanding growing attention towards sustainability, calculations of the carbon footprint and related mitigation actions in this sector are mainly carried out with reference only to the premises of the company, i.e., accounting for direct emissions from its facilities, while very little is known and done about the emissions caused by logistics and transport activities along the supply chain. This paper fills a gap in the literature, by presenting a case study of tank-to-wheel carbon emissions of a small-medium retail cooperative company located in the Campania region. The company's entire yearly transport attracted and generated has been reconstructed using company data and direct observations of warehouses, distribution centres, and stores. Interestingly, customers of retail stores have also been investigated to calculate their overall carbon footprint. Tank-to-wheel emissions were calculated using COPERT software. The analysis reveals interesting prospects for the carbon footprint of the retail sector and suggests a number of complementary actions to be implemented to make freight transport operations in the sector more sustainable.","","978-1-6654-8537-1","10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope54979.2022.9854699","University of Naples Federico II; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9854699","green road freight transport;GHG emissions;mass-market retail sector;case study","Databases;Greenhouse effect;Roads;Supply chains;Climate change;Low-carbon economy","","","","12","IEEE","19 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of the model is to be able to assess conducted emission currents at both inputs and outputs for fixed operating power in order to apply appropriate mitigation design rules, such as filtering. First, we propose a linear Thevenin block model of the converter considering it as a five-port linear black box allowing possible interaction between the DC and AC ports. To this extent, the block model is made of an impedance matrix and a Thevenin voltage generators vector. We also propose theoretical relationships allowing the processing of data to generate this model from measurements. Then, we test the linear simplifications on a real DC–AC converter and compare the results to measurements. For this, S-parameter measurements in off-mode and currents at the five ports in on-mode are used for the characterization of the model on a first test setup. The model is then applied and checked by comparing circuit simulated and measured current responses on a modified test setup for which the lengths of the connection cables are modified. Finally, the capability of this block model to extrapolate by calculation the response of other installation configurations is shown considering a filter and its insertion at input/output ports of the converter with much longer cables.","1558-187X","","10.1109/TEMC.2021.3080590","Office National d'études et de Recherches Aérospatiales; French DGAC MECEP SDC(grant numbers:2016 93 0800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9481299","Conducted electromagnetic emission;DC–AC converters;power electronics;Thevenin generalized model","Matrix converters;Integrated circuit modeling;Impedance;HVDC transmission;HVAC;Generators;Brushless motors","","2","","17","IEEE","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mobile ES poses challenges to the system since the connection location and time may be random. In this paper, the impacts of the stationary and mobile ES on the distribution transformers loss of life are quantified employing a probabilistic approach. Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to model the stochastic behavior of PEVs. For residential demand, ambient temperature and photovoltaic (PV) generation real data from College Station, Texas is used. Using the historical data of one year in this area, the impacts of different ES penetration level in the presence of PEV and PV are studied.

Following the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court on April 29, 2021, and with a view to the European climate target for 2030, the German government presented the amended Climate Protection Act on May 12, 2021. By this law, the heating sector in Germany is bound to reduce its CO2 emission of 118 million t in 2020 to 67 million t CO2 in 2030 [1]. This 43% reduction in ten years necessitates a comprehensive building renovation strategy and a rapid reconsideration of applicable heating technologies. Heat pumps offer a very efficient form of individual heat supply. On the other hand, concerns are being raised that power grids might not be able to serve the additional loads resulting from a high distribution of heat pumps and that only the gas grid can guarantee an affordable heat supply. The usage of green hydrogen for the heating sector is presented as the favorable option by the gas economy [2]. As a contribution to this ongoing discussion, the paper presents a comparison of costs for consumer and calculations of additional electricity grid loads for the city of Hamburg. The investment and operating costs for end consumers are extrapolated and compared for heat pumps, condensing boilers using natural gas and/or green hydrogen. In a second step, future heat pump scenarios are compared with the present situation to estimate possible grid overloads. The scenarios represent different refurbishment rates and a variation of district heating, decentralized renewable heating (i.e. wood pellets), and heat pumps. For evaluation purposes, the currently used power supply for direct power heating systems is assumed to be available for heat pumps.","2165-4093","978-1-6654-0896-7","10.1109/EEM54602.2022.9921141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921141","Heating Sector Hamburg;Direct Power Heating;Heat Pumps;Grid Constraints","Temperature measurement;Costs;Heat pumps;Hydrogen;Green products;Urban areas;Air pollution","","1","","18","IEEE","20 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes an integrated approach in predicting the short-term solar energy generation based on changing weather conditions.

Novel vehicles are projected to conquer our skies, including drones, air-taxis, low emissions, and supersonic aircraft. But getting there will require addressing a myriad of challenges, some related to propulsion technologies and many driven by environmental concerns. Central to all these is aviation’s focus on safety. Plasma technologies and gas discharge physics are well positioned to solve combustion challenges as well as adequately protect these novel vehicles in the Earth’s electrified atmosphere. In this talk I will cover research at the intersection of plasma science and aerospace engineering, including topics related to plasma-assisted combustion and lightning safety. Underlying these applications are principles of gas discharge physics, at largely disparate scales, from km in the atmosphere, to cm in technological applications, which will also be covered including the effects of being airborne. Plasma-assisted combustion is a promising approach to addressing challenging combustion regimes, e.g., ignition of supersonic flows, burning of carbon-free fuels including ammonia, stabilizing lean flames with the objective of reducing emissions, and more. Our work has focused on looking at the two-way coupling of the plasma-combustion interaction, from meso-scale conditions to high power systems, and with an emphasis on studying the impact of the dynamic combustion environment on the plasma regimes encountered. Lightning attachment to aircraft has been investigated for almost a century, and even though lightning risks are not a concern in aviation safety, thanks to strict protection and mitigation measures, lightning protection is as much a science as an art. The state of the practice heavily relies on historical information, experience, and testing: an approach that has worked extremely well while aircraft variations have been incremental but is becoming questionable when looking at the landscape of novel vehicles. To address this need, our work has focused on physics-models for assessment of the lightning threat, as well as innovations for protection and risk reduction.","2576-7208","978-1-6654-7925-7","10.1109/ICOPS45751.2022.9812965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812965","","Plasma-assisted combustion;Supersonic flow;Technological innovation;Terrestrial atmosphere;Discharges (electric);Safety;Aircraft","","","","0","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
