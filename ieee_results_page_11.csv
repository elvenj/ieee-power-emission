The investigation begins with the selection of the Diode-Clamped MLI topology for its inherent advantages in achieving multiple voltage levels with fewer switches. Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) techniques are employed to control the output voltage waveform, enabling precise voltage magnitude control. Selective Harmonic Elimination (SHE) strategies are implemented to mitigate harmonic content by selectively eliminating undesirable harmonics, significantly reducing Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization is utilized to fine-tune modulation indices and switching angles, leading to a substantial reduction in switch count. Experimental validation confirms the feasibility of the design, showcasing reduced switch count, enhanced performance, and minimized harmonic distortion.

Although grids are becoming healthier day by day and the World is moving towards Zero Carbon emissions. Most industries are running on fossil fuel Gensets, which is not an economical nor a long-term solution. In INDIA State Governments are encouraging and imposing PV Solar installation in industries to overcome the energy crisis in the coming times, as grids are becoming day by day more heavily loaded. A recent survey shows that Delhi is now the most polluted city in India resulting in the closing of all the thermal and gas power generation stations as they were creating pollution. To overcome this situation Grids, play a very important role as they are a single source to feed energy to industries, so to make the grid more powerful sustainable renewable energy sources need to be added as much as possible. During daytime energy demand is higher and PV solar is the best solution to meet this demand, industries need to take initiatives in this regard. The rooftop is the best location for any industry to install PV as the roof is the most ignored and underutilized space. With the help of PVSYS and STAAD software, we can find out the exact requirement and capacity of the structure to handle 170km/hr of wind pressure and also the dynamic load of the PV module. Capacity is calculated based on space available on the roof. The work represents a case study of with the whole project’s specifications.

Building automation and control systems (BACS), using ICT-based monitoring and management applications to reduce energy consumption, have long been considered a key technology to improve efficiency in the building sector but CO2 abatement potential is unclear. Most studies on the technology either use a vague definition of BACS or calculate on the basis of insufficiently evaluated applications and efficiency potential. This paper builds on a study previously conducted by the authors that analyzed CO2 reduction potential (Mt CO2 emissions saved) from clearly defined application scenarios of BACS in the residential and non-residential building sectors in Germany. Effects were calculated using secured efficiency factors derived from standards (EN ISO 15232, etc.). The methodological approach and the results of this study were subsequently used to apply the ETSI/ITU framework, in particular to evaluate application scenarios of building automation. Through application of the ETSI/ITU framework, the authors also draw preliminary conclusions for CO2 mitigation strategies in the building sectors of other European member states by discussing possible use of the framework for other housing and heating structures.","","978-1-6654-8286-8","10.1109/ICT4S55073.2022.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9830089","ICT-based energy monitoring and management;building automation and control systems;decarbonization potential in the building sector","Energy consumption;Buildings;Europe;Water heating;Low-carbon economy;Control systems;Sustainable development","","","","25","IEEE","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A general used solution is installing a static volt-ampere reactive (VAR) compensator (SVC) as the most cost-saving device, which still holds the risk of incomplete reactive power compensation subject to the operating delay time. To this end, an accurate extreme short-term reactive power forecasting structure is essential. Although there are many studies related to the forecasting of wind power in long, medium, and short terms, however, the extremely short-term reactive power prediction of the wind farms is only addressed in few studies. The main aim in this article is to develop a method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) to directly learn nonstationary and complex features from the raw wind farm reactive power time series and to contribute a predictive controller to mitigate the voltage flicker through an SVC connected to the wind farm. However, high sensitivity of typical mean-squared-based loss functions might lead to considerable errors in the forecasting. To resolve this issue, a modified loss function is proposed to enhance the performance and, consequently, an improved CNN is presented. The evaluation of the proposed method is based on the actual recorded data of a wind farm in Manjil, Iran. The data are directly used in the modeling of the wind farm. A current source, which is based on the actual records its amplitude and phase angle change every 0.01 s, is utilized to model the wind farm. The numerical results in terms of flicker sensation and short-term flicker perceptibility (Pst) measurement are used to verify the performance of the proposed method through comparison with the wind farm performance without SVC and SVC with a common control system.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3025101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200680","Convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;static VAR compensator (SVC);voltage flicker;wind farm","Wind farms;Reactive power;Forecasting;Static VAr compensators;Voltage fluctuations;Machine learning;Time series analysis","","11","","36","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EVs are creating opportunities as well as challenges by integrating to electric power sectors. Due to the unbalance EV charging load in a three phase-four wire distribution grid, there exists neutral current as well as voltage unbalance at each node or measurement point of common coupling (PCC). Several researchers have assessed the impact of EV penetration on voltage and power quality. Moreover, a few research work has been done for reducing the neutral current in an unbalanced distribution grid with higher EV penetration till now. This paper proposes a method to reduce the neutral current at the supporting feeder, which is achieved by optimizing the voltage unbalance at the PCC. In this paper, this study will solve the neutral current overrating problem using Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated by applying to a distribution grid. It is found that the proposed method can reduce the neutral current at the supporting feeder from 198.95 A to 19.45 A. The proposed method also reduces the neutral current at other nodes or PCCs up to 67.19%.

The simulation result that using a predistorter can improve the BER performance of 12dB on the HPA OFDM-4QAM nonlinear system and 18dB on the HPA FBMC-40QAM nonlinear system for IBO=-8.5dB.","","978-1-6654-8303-2","10.1109/CCWC54503.2022.9720842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9720842","FBMC;OQAM;Intrinsic Interference;nonlinear distortion;Predistorter","Degradation;Spectral efficiency;Transmitters;Conferences;Nonlinear distortion;Filter banks;Modulation","","1","","17","IEEE","4 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The CUS, also known as a counter-drone system, protects personal, commercial, public, and military facilities and areas from uncontrollable and belligerent UAVs by neutralizing or destroying them. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the CUS to describe the key technologies of the CUS and provide sufficient information with wich to comprehend this system. The first part starts with an introduction of general UAVs and the concept of the CUS. In the second part, we provide an extensive survey of the CUS through a top-down approach: i) the platform of CUS including ground and sky platforms and related networks; ii) the architecture of the CUS consisting of sensing systems, command-and-control (C2) systems, and mitigation systems; and iii) the devices and functions with the sensors for detection-and-identification and localization-and-tracking actions and mitigators for neutralization. The last part is devoted to a survey of the CUS market with relevant challenges and future visions. From the CUS market survey, potential readers can identify the major players in a CUS industry and obtain information with which to develop the CUS industry. A broad understanding gained from the survey overall will assist with the design of a holistic CUS and inspire cross-domain research across physical layer designs in wireless communications, CUS network designs, control theory, mechanics, and computer science, to enhance counter UAV techniques further.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3023473","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2018R1A4A1023826); Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program supervised by the Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2020-0-01787); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9194729","Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);unmanned aircraft system (UAS);counter UAV system (CUS);counter drone systems;public safety;defense","Drones;Industries;Military aircraft;Aircraft;Command and control systems","","76","","343","CCBY","11 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are lots of emissions of CO2 and GHGs by aviation industry which can be lower down by the use of electric engines. This paper summarizes the sizing and mission analysis of multirole short-haul all-electric seaplane. There are plenty of opportunities for this type of aircraft as the infrastructural requirements for the operation are much lower compared to those for the conventional aircraft. In this study, an electric seaplane is sized to meet twin operational requirements of a multi-role mission, viz., short-haul air transportation (SHAT) and Air Sea Rescue (ASR). It is seen that though the battery energy density required for the critical mission, viz. ASR, is extremely high (~2 kWhr/kg) but for SHAT, it is just 0.625 kWhr/kg, for comparable mass of fossil fuel. In comparison to a conventional aircraft using fossil fuels, the all-electric aircraft results in mitigation of 3600 kg CO2 emission in each ASR mission, thus establishing it as a potential solution for sustainable aviation.","","978-1-6654-1974-1","10.1109/CSDE50874.2020.9411375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9411375","Seaplane;Electric Aircraft;Performance;Power","Industries;Computer science;Conferences;Data engineering;Fossil fuels;Batteries;Aircraft","","","","6","IEEE","28 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, a few research work has been done for mitigating the unbalance in an unbalanced distribution grid with higher EV penetration till now. This paper proposes a method to mitigate voltage unbalance, the neutral current at the supporting feeder and minimize the re-phasing cost by optimizing load distribution among phases. This study will solve the multi-objective problem using Particle Swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated by applying to a distribution grid.

Building on these characteristics, a reinforcement learning (RL) model is designed to strategically schedule power and natural gas exchanges as well as the energy dispatch of energy hub. Case studies are performed by using real-time digital simulator that enables dynamic interactions between scheduling decisions and operating conditions. Simulation results show that the CRF-based RL method can approach the theoretical optimal scheduling solution after 50 days training. Scheduling decisions are particularly more dependent on received price information during peak-demand period. The proposed method can reduce 9.76% of operating cost and 1.388 ton of carbon emissions per day, respectively.","2474-9133","978-1-7281-0738-7","10.1109/ICCChinaW.2019.8849941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8849941","Energy hub;price elasticity;real-time digital simulator (RTDS);reinforcement learning (RL);conditional random field;carbon reduction","Cogeneration;Carbon dioxide;Boilers;Elasticity;Optimal scheduling;Natural gas;Resistance heating","","2","","20","IEEE","26 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A real-world test suggested that single-anchor ultra-wideband ranging provided sufficient accuracy for landing, radar odometry to avoid wind turbine blades required further research, and UAS ultrasonic noise emissions overlapped with bat echolocation calls. For noise mitigation, this study found that a bat detector placed 10 m below the source did not require acoustic attenuation, but the system benefited from deep learning methods to remove the remaining noise.

One approach is to equip a fully electric truck with a pantograph to operate the electric motor via an overhead catenary line (OCL) on designated routes and to charge the vehicle's internal battery during the drive. This approach can theoretically provide the long-haul vehicle with an infinite range, only geographically limited by the availability of the OCL. The pilot projects are currently being tested on public roads in countries like Germany and Sweden, whereas countries like India, France, the UK and China have expressed interest in the technology. Pantograph-based, electric drive concepts are classically used in trams, trolley buses and railway operations. However, when to be used without the guide rails, changed conditions lead to different requirements and a simple transfer of technology is not possible. Therefore, the application requires significant development work. Part of these changed requirements are the conditions of actuation and the safety management of the pantograph during operation. Due to unpredictable drive maneuvers of various traffic participants, as well as boundary conditions given by the road traffic regulatory body, extended safety functions are necessary. Main aspect of this is the monitoring of safe operation through a release process. This includes a driver release coupled with a release function on the vehicle control side, which monitors specific measurement data for compliance with the defined limiting values. It leads to a semi-automated and redundant release process, that ensures the safe functionality of the pantograph for all events that occur during operation. This paper introduces and classifies the concept of a release function and defines the actuation conditions of the pantograph system. In addition, implementation details and challenges are addressed to provide a comprehensive overview. The results were derived from a research project currently being undertaken at the Chair of Production Engineering of E-Mobility Components at the RWTH Aachen University and is supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.","","979-8-3503-2356-6","10.1109/ICPEEV58650.2023.10391838","RWTH Aachen University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10391838","Heavy duty vehicles;trucks;pantograph;electric drivetrain;safety function;OCL","Rails;Roads;Safety management;Production engineering;Particle measurements;Road traffic;Rail transportation","","","","19","IEEE","19 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
