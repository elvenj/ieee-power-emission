Therefore, in this study the off-grid areas of Punjab, Pakistan are located through night-time satellite imagery and the data is substantiated through the Pakistan Bureau of statistics database. Furthermore, the solar energy potential of selected regions is evaluated and is followed up by economic viability related to those regions. The outcome of this study endorsed that south Punjab regions have acceptable solar irradiation to be harnessed for electricity generation. Moreover, the economic analysis based on the Levelized Cost of energy has been done which revealed that the cost of producing electricity through solar PV system is PKR 10.7/kWh and the electricity generated through conventional energy sources is around 20.79/kWh. Furthermore, by installing the solar PV system in un-electrified rural areas, high level of CO2 could be mitigated.

For example, prior to failure, aberrant thermal readings, noise, and spark emissions may be detected (in addition to aberrant current and voltage waveforms). The equipment at key poles servicing the hospital can be monitored for aberrations; likewise, the power systems within the hospital can also be monitored for aberrations. In this way, service personnel may be dispatched prior to terminal failure. This hyper-locale power aberration assessment mechanism enables predictive/preventive (leveraging early indicators and warnings of potential power reliability and stability issues) maintenance rather than simply corrective maintenance (allowing the system to operate until the equipment fails).

However, nearly all investigations have been conducted under either DC or 50/60 $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{Z}}$ sinusoidal AC voltages, even though the actual operation of envisioned (U)WBG power modules involves high-frequency square voltages with high slew rates. It has been validated by several studies that fast rise times of square voltages rapidly degrade the breakdown strength of insulation materials, leading to premature failure. Therefore, this paper introduces a nonlinear resistive field grading material or field-dependent conductivity (FDC) layer around the TP and metal edges to evaluate the electric field mitigation under a high frequency and high slew rate square voltage. The modeling and simulation of both coated and uncoated (U)WBG substrates were performed in COMSOL Multiphysics to assess the electric field reduction with the nonlinear FDC layer. The improvement of reduction in electric field under 100 kHz high slew rate square voltage is compared with that of 60 Hz. The results reveal a significant decrease in field stress at the TP, even under square voltages with fast rise times and high frequencies, when applying a nonlinear FDC coating, as opposed to the uncoated substrate. The influence of switching field $(\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{b}})$ and nonlinearity coefficient $(\alpha)$ of nonlinear FDC layer is studied under 100 kHz square voltage, and it is concluded that $\alpha$ and $\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{b}}$ should be more than 10 and less than 8 kV/mm, respectively to achieve effective performance of resistive field grading material.","","979-8-3503-3120-2","10.1109/TPEC60005.2024.10472176","U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:2306093); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10472176","(U) WBG power modules;high frequency;high slew rate;nonlinear field grading material;triple points;electric field reduction;packaging","Insulation;Multichip modules;Metals;Switches;Conductivity;High frequency;Electric fields","","1","","26","IEEE","22 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, frontloading is an excellent approach to analyzing and monitoring the EMI/EMC performance from the design stage (Pre-prototype) to the verification stage (post-Prototype), allowing a cost-effective resolution of any upstream issues. A major pain point faced by EMC engineers is the lack of accurate models for Integrated Circuits, currently IBIS models and SPICE simulations are being taken to model the ICs behavior which are not useful at higher frequency ranges. Therefore, the motivation of this work is to develop a DC-DC Boost converter IC model using the Nonlinear IC-Emission Modelling method and to analyze different EMI mitigation methods to reduce the PCB emissions during the design phase. The proposed model is implemented on the DUT with the Boost converter IC fabricated on the PCB.

The country faces challenges with solar panels due to harsh weather conditions, primarily dust, and high temperatures. An often-neglected problem is the contamination of PV surfaces, so-called “soiling” which leads to significantly reduced energy yields, especially in high-insolation arid and semi-arid climates. Indeed, an inadequate or absent soiling mitigation strategy in high solar-potential and soiling-prone locations such as the Middle East can cancel out in few weeks the surge in solar cell and concentrated solar power (CSP) efficiency improvement made in recent years. This would potentially render an installation economically unviable and therefore must be mitigated. This study proposes two approaches to mitigate soiling, namely, hydrophobic coating and flipping. Interestingly, results show that the coating and flipping approach have increased power generation by about 11% compared to non-coated, non-flipped panels. Further research is needed to elucidate these results.","","979-8-3503-0626-2","10.1109/SGRE59715.2024.10429033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10429033","PV soiling;PV hydrophobic coating;dust mitigation;PV resilience;energy efficiency","Renewable energy sources;Surface contamination;Energy efficiency;Coatings;Sustainable development;Surges;Meteorology","","","","14","IEEE","15 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The analysis covers all energy sectors (electricity, heat and mobility) and shows that priority should be given to heat and mobility. Results show that the cheapest growth is based on fossil energies.

For most of the vacuum-dielectric devices, vacuum flashovers usually occur at the solid-vacuum interface due to its weaker surface strength, leading to the damage of the whole insulation system. In this paper, an investigation is conducted regarding the vacuum flashover inhibition and positive charge accumulation reduction using microstructure of embedded silver wires. The mechanism of multipactor suppression through surface printed metal structure is studied by establishing a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation based on secondary electron emission avalanche (SEEA) theory. Meanwhile, the multipactor expansion and the charge accumulation process on the interface are simulated to study the multipactor mitigation phenomenon of printed metal wires. Different widths, positions and numbers of metal wires are also simulated. It is found that a certain amount of negative charge can gather on the silver metal microstructure due to its low secondary emission yield (SEY), forming an electric field to scatter electrons and inhibit multipactor propagation. Increasing width of printed metal wires is beneficial for improving this suppression effect on vacuum flashover. At last, some relative experiments are conducted and a considerable improvement in flashover strength is acquired, to provide further confirmation of the simulation results.","","978-1-6654-1104-2","10.1109/CIEEC54735.2022.9845948","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9845948","vacuum flashovers;printed metal wires;PIC simulation;secondary emission yield;flashover strength","Silver;Vacuum systems;Simulation;Wires;Scattering;High-voltage techniques;Flashover","","","","11","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In alignment with other countries' efforts towards climate change mitigation and sustainability, Denmark is committed to achieving a 70% reduction in emissions by 2030 and ultimately reaching zero emissions by 2050 within its borders. While solar and wind power are the primary sources of renewable energy, their intermittent nature poses challenges when energy demand is high. Consequently, energy storage emerges as a critical concern. To address this, sector coupling and an efficient energy trading system are pivotal, as they interconnect energy- consuming sectors with power-producing sectors to maximize the efficient utilization of renewable energy.

A low or medium voltage dc distribution system is usually used for solar integration. In dc systems, parallel and series arc faults are a safety concern. Thus, reliable and timely detection and mitigation of arc faults are critical. DC arc detection methods typically use time or frequency spectrum variations of the circuit current or voltage to differentiate the arcing event from other system events. Since practical systems include power electronics and maximum-power-point tracking, any detection scheme must perform robustly in the electrical environment that these components establish in the dc power system. A capacitor placed in parallel with the main system is an effective sensor for series arc fault detection and localization applicable in this complex electrical environment. This article shows that the analysis of the amplitude, polarity, and spectrum characteristics of the capacitor current and voltage resulting from perturbations caused by the arc provides an effective method to identify and localize faults. The detection accuracy of the proposed approach is 98.3% and the localization accuracy rate is 100% for the correctly detected faults.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2023.3306073","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52007149); Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program(grant numbers:BX20190267); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M663713); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10236501","Arc faults;photovoltaic (PV) system faults;series arc fault detection;series arc fault localization","Circuit faults;Capacitors;Sensors;Fault detection;Voltage;Location awareness;Photovoltaic systems;Arc discharges","","3","","29","IEEE","31 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Ministry of Environment in its Third National Communication Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change proposed different mitigation solutions including the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) and fuel efficiency systems. The main motivation is to replace diesel-fuelled cars with EVs starting from 2020 in Rwanda [1]. EVs are projected to replace 150,000 passenger cars by 2050 and according to the projection, these EVs will require an average of 30 kWh per 100 km [1]. In this paper, a feasibility study of introducing EVs in Rwanda’s transport system is investigated. Simulation results show that 1.5% of the registered private vehicles, 10% of the registered buses and 10% of the registered taxis charging at 10 kW can be replaced with EVs with a minimal impact on voltage profiles. This study found that 1%, 8% and 8% of the registered private vehicles, buses and taxis can be supported with 20 kW chargers. However, an addition of two large-scale distributed generation (DG) units is required with 20 kW chargers in the network.","","978-1-7281-2956-3","10.1109/ENERGYCon48941.2020.9236568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9236568","Electric vehicles;Rwanda distribution network;load flow analysis;voltage control;power losses","Substations;Simulation;Urban areas;Electric vehicles;Automobiles;Public transportation;Load modeling;Climate change","","3","","17","IEEE","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
