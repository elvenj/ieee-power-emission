This paper proposes a bi-level carbon trading scheme on demand side considering the energy consumption level of users and low-carbon demand response. In the upper-level market, an optimal step-based carbon prices customization model is built to impose differentiated incentives on users, thereby balancing the emission mitigation and social welfare. In the lower-level market, a carbon trading mechanism based on the competitive auction program is proposed, then an optimal carbon trading strategy is studied to maximize the consumer surplus and further motivate the low-carbon energy consumption. On the source side, a low-carbon dispatching model of IEGS considering the flexible carbon capture power plant and power-to-gas (CCPP-P2G) is established.

Curtailment of RE generation is also an increasing concern in the electric power system. At present, a large amount of both wind and solar energy generation is connected to the power systems in California. This imposes new challenges in the grid and leads to curtailment of renewable energy resources. This paper presents solutions for reducing RE curtailment in California. The optimal energy management problem for minimizing RE Curtailment is formulated as a resource allocation and scheduling problem based on the actual supply-demand scenario in California in 2020. A quantitative study of the RE curtailment reduction potential in California is developed based on various existing and envisaged opportunities in the state. RE curtailment is reduced by first controlling the output of the Hydro Power Plant, then the reduced curtailed energy is exported to other grids who require power especially during peak demand intervals. The remaining curtailment energy is then stored into an Energy Storing System (ESS) typically being Battery.

This study focuses on Ghana’s commitment to emission reduction goals outlined in the country’s Energy Transition Framework, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and the Fourth National Communication (NC4) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These goals recognize the significance of external assistance in achieving a conditional 30% reduction target, along with an unconditional 15% reduction strategy. By utilizing the IAEA MESSAGE model, a comprehensive quantitative analysis is conducted to assess the effectiveness of additional installed capacity of clean energy technologies, mainly renewables and nuclear energy, in mitigating climate change, considering the role of external support. The results highlight the need for a transition from fossil fuel-based sources to low-carbon alternatives such as renewables and nuclear energy to meet emission reduction targets and promote sustainable development. Also, despite the higher investment cost associated with the additional installed capacity, the mitigation measures deployed in the electricity system reduced CO2 emissions by 15% (4,142.2 kilotons). Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of additional clean energy capacity to meet the growing electricity demand, facilitated by external aid.

Leveraging publicly accessible datasets from the Irish transmission system operator's data portal, the approach incorporates historical mean carbon intensity time series and system generation data. Our findings reveal that even minor fluctuations in demand could lead to significant increases in marginal carbon emissions, contingent upon the system's conditions concerning variations in renewable generation and interconnector flow.

REC can play an important role in the development of green hydrogen, which can be produced in a decentralized way and used as an energy vector for various applications, such as transport and energy storage. The aim of this research is to evaluate the cost of hydrogen in distributed energy systems. The province of Taranto was chosen as a case study to model various supply scenarios for a 100 kW electrolyzer for local hydrogen production to be used within a Renewable Hydrogen Community. The results show that the optimal supply mix consists of 150 kW of photovoltaic and 100 kW of onshore wind installations, resulting in an annual hydrogen production of 7,565 kgH2/yr, an excess of electrical energy produced of 27,686 kWh/yr, and a Levelized Cost of the produced Hydrogen (LCOH) of 3.82 €/kgH2. The study highlights the potential use of hydrogen in different sectors, contributing to the reduction of local CO2 emissions.

Accordingly, the transition to renewable energy sources such as solar energy is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thereby, climate change mitigation. Recognizing this, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has increased the share of solar energy in the country’s energy production. In addition, increasing the share of solar-based renewable energy enhances energy security in Cambodia. However, solar energy faces problems such as instability and fluctuation, which have negative impacts on the electrical grid. Such issues occur when a sudden change occurs in the energy demand. Among different solutions, the battery storage system is needed to minimize solar photovoltaic (PV) power fluctuation and increase grid reliability. Yet, the investment in the battery storage system is still high, which affects the electricity price from solar farms. We proposed a method to smooth the solar PV power output from the solar farm by applying a Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter in the battery storage system and optimizing the battery size for cost savings. The Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter was suitable for smoothing solar PV output compared to other smoothing methods.

The power grids are still facing the experience of more penetration to satisfy electricity demand of the consumer. Another reason for solar PV penetration is government subsidies for the customers, decreasing the capital cost of solar PV, feed-in-tariff and to balance the CO2 emission from the atmosphere. The integration of PV system in low voltage or medium voltage ((LV/MV) distribution networks is raising new challenges in terms of power quality (PQ). In the LV/MV distribution networks, PQ problems are voltage sag and swell are the most serious concern, and it occurs when residential renewable energy sources (i.e., solar PV) produce more energy than the local demand. As per the PQ studies, voltage sag/ swell issues in the LV/MV power grid considered to be the most common type of PQ issue. Impact of this type of issue on sensitive loads is harsh. Hence, different types of solution have been used to protect sensitive loads from such voltage problems, but the dynamic voltage restorer is to be considered, effective and efficient solution. Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is a series connected power electronic device which is used to alleviate the voltage sag/swell problem in the distribution system and restore the load voltage to the required value. Therefore, the main objective of this research project is to investigate and understand the impact of PQ issues in LV/MV distribution system and aim is to alleviate them.

In recent years great attention has been turned to the development of sustainable fisheries, especially in terms of fuel consumption reduction and following emission mitigation. Increasing the share of renewable energy sources, alternative fuels, monitoring devices and innovative technologies in general onboard ships is a common trend. Hybrid power systems can produce electricity from two or more sources, typically renewable ones. As a result, it can employ solar energy while the sun is out and another source, like wind, in cloudy weather, assuring a more consistent and effective supply. Also, the system can consist of a generator powered by two or more different forms of fuel (such as LNG, biodiesel, hydrogen…). A hybrid energy system is an effective strategy for moving away from economies that rely on fossil fuels. It is still an emerging technology, which is expected to evolve and thus have wider applicability and lower costs. However, the need for high-quality and detailed analysis of hybrid energy solutions has increased due to the great diversity of fishing vessels, different operational regimes, high investment costs, and the complexity of adapting the ship's energy system to new technologies. Given that the improvement of the Croatian fishing fleet in an environmental sense began recently, it is necessary to investigate possible hybrid energy configurations and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. This paper presents hybrid energy systems with: (a) series drivetrain; (b) parallel drivetrain; (c) series-parallel drivetrain. Their characteristics and effect on the ships' power system are explained in detail.

MG has become a key research element in smart grid and distribution power systems. MG mainly contains different renewable energy sources (RESs) that use various technological advancements, such as power electronics-based technologies. However, it has an unstable output, thereby causing different types of power quality (PQ) events. As a result, standards and mitigation methods have been developed in recent years. To mitigate PQ issues due to MG integration, various methods and standards have been proposed over the last years. Although these individual methods are well documented, a comparative overview had not been introduced so far. Thus, this study aims to fill the gap by reviewing and comparing the prior-art PQ issues, solutions, and standards in MGs. We compare the main issues related to voltage sag, voltage swell, voltage and current harmonics, system unbalances, and fluctuations to ensure high-quality MG output power. The new technologies associated with MGs generate harmonics emission in the range of 2-150 kHz, thereby causing a new phenomenon, namely, supraharmonics (SH) emission, which is not sufficiently covered in the literature. Therefore, the characteristics, causes, consequences, and measurements of SH are highlighted and analyzed. The mitigation strategies, control, and devices of PQ issues are also discussed. Moreover, a comparison is conducted between the most popular devices used to mitigate the PQ issues in MG in terms of cost, rating, and different aspects of performance.

However, this low-carbon transition can not be effective and efficient without financial incentives and equitable charges. This paper proposes a low-carbon economic scheduling framework for multi-level integrated electricity and gas systems by introducing a carbon-embedded locational marginal price (LMP) under a carbon trading scheme. The framework is modeled as a hierarchical problem, and its upper layer aims to minimize the total energy supply cost. In contrast, the lower layer aims to maximize consumer surplus with planned PV panels for regional micro-grids based on the LMP and local carbon credits. Meanwhile, the superiority of power-to-gas (P2g) facilities in emission mitigation are involved. Carbon emission flow (CEF) model is employed to trace the carbon footprint.

At the same time, the locational marginal price (LMP) for electricity based on the optimal scheduling model is determined at the upper level. Then, at the lower level, a carbon-emission embedded demand side management (DSM) strategy is introduced, which can manage demands in response to electricity price and influence end-users to contribute to carbon reduction and economic benefits. The whole bi-level model is solved iteratively and reaches an equilibrium.

Nevertheless, this emerging technology poses significant challenges in terms of energy management, stability, and power quality. Power quality deteriorates mainly in the grid due to the presence of harmonics condition. Due to the harmonics yielding from power electronic devices, maintaining power quality in DC grids is a challenging task. A similar issue is well investigated in the AC power system but is yet to be fully investigated in DC grid. To this end, this paper investigates the impact of control systems on the power quality in the common DC bus of a DC grid. To do so, first, a small-scale DC microgrid is considered and three methodologies including impedance scanning, fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis, and time domain simulation are applied. Second, the impact of disturbances on power quality in DC Bus is explored. Finally, a mitigation technique based on the LQR approach is proposed. Through case studies, it is shown that the outcome of this research can potentially be used for modeling LVDC grid, reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions.","","978-1-5386-7434-5","10.1109/GTDAsia.2019.8715875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8715875","DC grid;DC resonance;LQR controller;Power quality","Power system stability;Impedance;Stability analysis;Harmonic analysis;Power electronics;Power system harmonics;Power quality","","7","","22","IEEE","16 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today, energy accounts for two-thirds of total greenhouse gases emissions, therefore, efforts in this sector are of major importance to reduce the global impacts. This can be accomplished through the use of distributed generation to meet the increased demand. Distributed generation includes on-site renewables such as solar or wind power. The optimal integration of these sources in the network requires optimization models to accurately locate and size them based on needs. This paper proposes to use dynamic optimal power flow (OPF) modeling to localize and size the Photovoltaic (PV) production sources and storage batteries (SB) needed on an over-solicited grid by additional demand, in a spatial-temporal framework. To do so, while respecting the different constraints (solar local resources, cost analysis…), a linear optimization is performed to minimize the production costs and to define the optimal installed surface of PV to maximize the individual load factor of each PV, while respecting all the network’s constraints.","","978-1-6654-2052-5","10.1109/ICGEA54406.2022.9791941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9791941","electrical network;renewable sources;optimal power flow;linear optimization;storage systems","Renewable energy sources;Costs;Production;Wind power generation;Power grids;Batteries;Distributed power generation;Climate change","","2","","29","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thermal generating units consider the fuel and emission costs together while complying with economic load dispatch. On the other hand, green energy sources such as wind power plants reduce the cost of thermal power generators along with emission mitigation despite the wind speed uncertainties. Therefore in this paper, an economic emission dispatch optimization model is represented, which caters to the fuel cost, emission cost, and the wind power cost altogether. To solve such a complex optimization problem, a new algorithm called the Opposition-based Competitive Swarm Optimizer (OCSO) algorithm is used in this work. Three-fourths of the total swarm is updated in each iteration of the OCSO algorithm, which is a modified version of the Competitive Swarm Optimizer algorithm (CSO). The OCSO has the ability to improve the exploration property of the original CSO algorithm most effectively. To prove the efficacy of OCSO, several case studies are conducted and analyzed. The convergence results demonstrate the more extraordinary exploration ability of the algorithm in comparison to others.","","978-1-6654-5566-4","10.1109/PEDES56012.2022.10080573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10080573","Economic Emission Dispatch;Swarm-based algorithm;Opposition based Competitive Swarm Optimizer;Wind Farm","Costs;Uncertainty;Wind speed;Green products;Wind farms;Wind power generation;Power electronics","","1","","17","IEEE","30 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes a power quality problem of high voltages occurs after the installation of a small hydropower plant of 800 kVA in an area with predominantly industrial consumers. Many industries use high technology for manufacturing and require high power quality and reliability of power supply. Even modest power quality problems can have significant technical and economic effects on these consumers. Therefore, it was necessary to precisely monitor power quality to adequately address all related problem recorded during the plant performance test phase. Also, the observed problem has led to power plant outage on several occasions in a short period of time which resulted in a reduction in power generation. Techniques for mitigation the observed power quality issue are also considered in this paper.

This paper proposes a low-carbon electricity network transition model, helping to plan aging CFPP retirement and renewable power plants installation as well as network augmentation. The trade-off decisions are found among three conflicting objectives including cost, risk and carbon emission. Moreover, the carbon emission flow (CEF) model is applied in the planning process to calculate carbon emissions from the demand side, in order to assess the efficacy of the low-carbon transition. A relatively new multi-objective natural aggregation algorithm (MONAA) is introduced and applied to find the optimal solution.
