At the same time, in many countries there are being raised the idea of transition to 100% RES. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the technical potential of the photovoltaic renewable energy sources available in Republic of Moldova with scope to contribute to achievement the goals of the Energy Strategy until 2030, the main state document in the field of energy. The Republic of Moldova is an Associate Membership of the EU and a Membership of Energy Community. These facts determines the country’s development direction and policies of its energy sector. The goals of this Strategy include diversification of energy sources, inclusively RES, ensuring the share of annual electricity production from RES at least 15% (about 1,274 TWh) in 2030 and reducing greenhouse gases emissions by 25% in 2020. Republic of Moldova has an insignificant amount of fossil energy resources (coal, natural gas and oil). At the same time, the renewable electricity production is insignificant and the economy entirely depends on imports of fossil energy resources from neighbor countries. Thus, there is considerable delay in achieving Strategy’s goals.","","978-1-7281-4011-7","10.1109/SIELMEN.2019.8905853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8905853","renewable energy technical potential;photovoltaic energy;electricity production;electricity sources","Radiation effects;Electric potential;Climate change;Solar energy;Satellites;Spatial resolution","","1","","14","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Employing galvanic isolation in the transceivers of such networks has become an essential requisite to guarantee safety and better reliability in harsh industrial environment. For industrial transceivers, isolated power levels between 100mW and 1W are required. Transciever size and cost are also constrained in many industrial applications. However, delivering 100s of mW is challenging for fully integrated solutions without bulky external transformers, and it is also important to control radiated emissions at such power levels. In [1], [2], different ways of implementing fully integrated isolated power links have been proposed. However, they can only deliver 10s of mW, which limits them to low-power applications, e.g., sensor interfaces. Some of the state-of-the-art commercial devices use on-chip transformers made from thick gold traces to deliver 500mW at 33% efficiency [3], but a 4-layer PCB is required to implement a stitching capacitor across the isolation barrier to meet CISPR 22 Class B Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) standards [4]. ln this work, a fully integrated galvanic isolated power transfer system is proposed. By adopting various circuit techniques, 800mW output capability and 34% efficiency is achieved, and component-level emissions are kept low, eliminating the need for costly EMI-mitigation techniques and simplifying the EMI-certification process.","2376-8606","978-1-5386-8531-0","10.1109/ISSCC.2019.8662349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8662349","","Oscillators;Harmonic analysis;Electromagnetic interference;Power generation;Coils;Capacitors;Resonant frequency","","13","","4","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One critical mitigation strategy identified was to reduce the carbon emission. New power systems thus have been strategically proposed to achieve the carbon neutrality target in China by 2060. It requires the coordinated operations among the generation, network, load and energy storage sectors, where the transmission and distribution networks are also more tightly connected. Load analysis, specifically load uncertainty analysis, would be necessary to provide deeper insights for the system operation and planning. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised learning based aggregated load uncertainty analysis approach. Tensor decomposition was applied to decompose the aggregated load profiles collected through SCADA, PMU, smart meters or distribution-level PMUs. The joint aggregation effects were analyzed through the decomposed component profiles. Uncertainty information was extracted through such profiles accordingly.

Its influence is felt as a barrier in financial, social, infrastructural, and political development. Despite having an enormous amount of renewable energy sources, these countries are unable to fulfil their current energy demand. While the power sector is entirely dependent on hydropower, other sectors depend on fossil fuel imports from India. This study offers a pathway for energy independency, energy for all and transition towards a 100% renewables based energy system. The modelling of the energy sector is done using the LUT Energy System Transition model for a period from 2015 to 2050 in a 5-year time step. This study covers the main energy sectors: power, heat, and transport. Two scenarios are visualised, one considering greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and the associated mitigation cost and another without these costs, though both scenarios aim at achieving a high share of renewable energy by 2050. A substantial drop in levelised cost of energy is observed for the scenario without GHG emission cost, however, taxing GHG emissions will accelerate the energy transition with the levelised cost of energy on a similar level. It is well possible to transition from 90 €/MWh in 2015 to 49 €/MWh by 2050 for the entire energy system by utilizing indigenous low-cost renewable energy. Solar photovoltaics and hydropower will play a dominant role in 2050, having a share of 67% and 31% respectively. Consequently, this leads to zero GHG emissions. An energy transition towards a sustainable and secure energy system for all by 2050 is well possible in Nepal and Bhutan only through 100% renewable sources and it is both technically and economically feasible despite having substantial limitations in infrastructure and economic development currently.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3087204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448098","100% renewable energy;Nepal;Bhutan;energy transition;Himalayan countries;hydropower;solar photovoltaics","Hydroelectric power generation;Biomass;Energy consumption;Statistics;Sociology;Petroleum;Electric potential;Climate change","","15","","96","CCBY","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, extensive research has been carried out on the cloud data center to reduce power consumption due to operating costs and CO2 emissions. To provide a prominent solution for reducing power consumption in the cloud center, we proposed a novel VM allocation technique that overcomes the Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation and allocates the VM to the best host through Improvised Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO) Algorithm. The proposed VM allocation technique takes into account host characteristics such as power consumption and CPU utilization to evaluate the best fit. After VM allocation, we evaluate the remaining capacity of CPU and RAM of the host, which enhances the resource utilization in the cloud center. The experiment was carried out on random datasets with different VMs. The performance of the proposed VM allocation technique is compared to the existing VM migration algorithm like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and PABFD (Power-Aware Best Fit Decreasing), the result shows that the proposed method provides a significant performance in terms of energy consumption, SLA violation, and several VM migrations.

Earlier research and field analysis have corroborated presence of interharmonic emission from PV connected inverters, with MPPT being amongst the main driving forces of interharmonics. In this sense, MPPT factors like sampling rate have a significant impact on PV system's interharmonic characteristic. While choosing sample rate of MPPT method, there is a trade-off among interharmonic emission and MPPT performance in general. Using a faster MPPT sample rate, for example, will enhance MPPT efficiency while also increasing interharmonic emission levels. To address the issue, this proposal proposes a new solution for interharmonics in PV systems. Because of frequency spectrum distribution, interharmonics in output current may be efficiently decreased. conversely, the suggested technique's MPPT performance can be maintained in the same way as when a fast MPPT sampling rate is used. suggested interharmonic mitigation's efficacy has been tested using a three-phase reduction on a PV- grid-connected system under partial shading condition.

Thus, it becomes crucial to analyse the TeDP system under extreme conditions and analyse the survivability under those transient conditions. Reconfiguration under extreme failure events is a way to meet the load demand. However, this creates a transient overload condition due to the fuel map limit of the turboshaft prime mover and affects the DC bus voltage. It is important to understand the survivability of the system during these extreme conditions which can lead to a collapse of the system and can present instability issue because of the CPL. In this work a mathematical analysis of the survivability of the system is presented in order to make it resilient. To prevent the collapse of the system a mitigation strategy has been proposed using the energy storage system which makes the turboshaft to remain in the safe zone.

In recent years, Bangladesh has had a significant energy crisis due to the scarcity of fossil fuels as an indirect effect of the economic downturn after the COVID-19 epidemic and the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The persistent power outages have detrimentally impacted both economic output and investor confidence. The implementation of floating solar photovoltaic (FSPV) plants has emerged as a feasible solution to address the energy crisis in Bangladesh and alleviate the lack of energy resources. This article thoroughly examined the feasibility of FSPV systems regarding technical, economic, and ecological considerations by conducting PVsyst simulations in several appropriate lakes in the Dhaka Metropolitan region. The study found that by harnessing 5% and 10% of the surface area of the selected lakes, it is possible to achieve a DC capacity of 27.5 MW and 55 MW, resulting in an annual power generation of about 48,282.736 MWh and 93,749.817 MWh respectively. The article investigated the economic viability using the levelized cost of energy metric, revealing an average LCOE of $0.17/kWh. Additionally, the study highlights the potential of FSPV systems to reduce yearly CO2 emissions by 29,355.90349 and 56,999.88874 tons by utilizing 5% and 10% resources respectively. This substantial decrease in emissions significantly contributes to the carbon reduction targets of the country.

Studies have found that the industrial sector accounts for 33% of worldwide energy use. The damage we have caused to the earth after the industrial revolution is enormous. Embarking on efficient energy management will be the most feasible manoeuvre to prevent further damage, which can be done by adopting low-consumption devices accompanied by permanent monitoring and improvement programs. Bangladesh has progressed much in power generation but still lags in power transmission and distribution systems. To recover the transmission and distribution loss, the demand for power generation increases, leading to extensive emissions of CO2. Moreover, Increased heating of equipment and conductors is a common symptom of power quality issues caused in the power grid due to the harmonic frequencies. If a power grid is to be as energy efficient as possible, transformers must be given close attention. Hence employing eco-designed transformers will be an intelligent solution for mitigating the energy crisis. Reduction of no-load losses of transformers can provide thousand MW of power, which will be ample for ensuring the rural electrification of our country. All the advanced countries worldwide are now adopting green transformers to save energy and protect the planet. Using eco-designed transformers, one can save minimal no-load loss equivalent to about 2,898,000 BDT. Global climate changes due to excessive CO2 emissions cause global warming, whereas around 37% of CO2 emission is caused by electricity production. European companies are bound to produce and use eco-designed transformers, and the USA will implement them soon. It is high time that the Bangladesh government came forward to take necessary measures for producing eco-friendly transformers like Europe and America.

Selective harmonic mitigation pulsewidth modulation (SHMPWM) is a very interesting technique for high power converters to meet the maximum harmonic emission levels, while keeping a low switching frequency. However, the combination of this modulation with a proportional integral (PI) controller requires slow dynamics, which makes it difficult to comply with the dynamic response requirements of grid codes. As an alternative, model predictive control (MPC) offers a very fast dynamic response, but a wide spread harmonic spectrum in steady state. Thus, the combination of MPC with a PI controller with SHMPWM is advantageous. In this work, a dual-stage control strategy is implemented. During transients, finite control set MPC (FCS-MPC) is activated to rapidly drive the current to the desired reference, while in steady state, the PI controller with SHMPWM is used. Therefore, the dual-stage control strategy allows to comply with the two requirements of grid codes, becoming a suitable strategy for grid-connected converters.","2643-3958","979-8-3503-1149-5","10.1109/ACEMP-OPTIM57845.2023.10287062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10287062","Selective Harmonic Mitigation Pulsewidth Modulation;Model Predictive Control;Linear Control;Gridconnected Power Converter","PI control;Codes;Voltage fluctuations;Switching frequency;Power system dynamics;Pulse width modulation;Harmonic analysis","","","","14","IEEE","1 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compliance enterprises, financial institutions, and individual investors are allowed to participate in the national carbon market and the complex trading interactions among these heterogeneous participants will make the market dynamics difficult to predict and analyze, bringing challenges to market design and regulations. Guided by the framework of cyber-physical-social system in energy (CPSSE), this paper constructs a hybrid simulation environment based on the Dynamic Simulation platform for Macro-Energy Systems (DSMES), in order to study the herding behavior effects on carbon market under different scenario settings. The behavior models of different carbon traders such as compliance enterprises, offset developers and financial institutions are analyzed and constructed. Then, the herding behavior effects are studied under different market scenario settings such as the supply of carbon emission allowance (CEA) and carbon offset credits (COC). Finally, key insights are discussed based on multi-scenario case studies, which provide decision support for market design and regulation.","","978-1-6654-3425-6","10.1109/EI252483.2021.9713274","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0903000); Basic Theories and Methods of Analysis and Control of the Cyber Physical Systems for Power Grid, and the Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China(grant numbers:SGFJDK00PJJS1700186); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9713274","china national carbon market;cyber physical-social system in energy;hybrid simulation;herding behavior;behavior model","Climate change;Analytical models;Atmospheric measurements;Conferences;Carbon dioxide;System integration;Particle measurements","","","","20","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conceptually, carbon is captured from the emission sources, especially from the power plants and industries. A few amounts of captured CO2 can be recycled or utilized in many industrial processes by converting it into products and services instead of storing. The objective of this paper is to review and propose the opportunities of the implementation of CCU in Thailand's industries. The results indicate that four main industries have high opportunity in CO2 utilization. For instance, in the chemical industry, the captured CO2 can be utilized to produce olefin, polymer, and methanol, used as raw materials producing, i.e., fiber, plastic, elastomers, wood enamel, paints, drugs, etc. For the cement industry, the captured CO2 can be transformed into calcium or magnesium carbonates, which are the raw material used to produce the construction materials. The captured CO2 can be used as a solvent instead of water in the dyed fabric or textile industry. Lastly, it could be one of the natural refrigerants in cooling systems, replacing hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).","","979-8-3503-3326-8","10.1109/ICUE55325.2022.10113466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113466","Carbon capture and utilization;Thailand's industries;Climate change mitigation;Carbon neutrality 2050;Net-zero GHG emissions","Solvents;Limiting;Raw materials;Magnesium;Plastics;Textile industry;Refrigerants;Climate change mitigation;Carbon emissions;Climate change","","","","45","IEEE","4 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This control performs multiple functions like load balancing, harmonics mitigation and reactive power compensation. The control scheme simplified SSLKF (Steady State Linear Kalman Filter) based FLL (Frequency Locked Loop) obtains the fundamental grid voltages component. The voltage across the capacitor called DC link voltage, is regulated by VSC at a desired value. The extracted solar PV power is delivered to load as well as to grid.

Being one of the most polluted aircontaining countries, mitigation of dust effect is a challenge for Bangladesh. In this paper, an analysis of dust impact on the performance of PV module in tropical weather countries is compared. Then, a case has been investigated with two small PV systems at Savar, Dhaka. The first PV system was cleaned three times a day, whereas the second one was cleaned after three days. The overall 3% reduction of output power and module efficiency is found for the system, which is cleaned after three days. Furthermore, maximum power is reduced in the afternoon (4.00 PM) in a day. It concludes with the recommendation that; Bangladesh needs to take inclusive dust mitigation strategies for the substantial development in PV systems.","","978-1-6654-3843-8","10.1109/ACMI53878.2021.9528120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9528120","solar PV;soiling loss;dust effect;output power","Photovoltaic systems;Mechatronics;Cleaning;Environmental factors;Meteorology","","1","","34","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While several SBS mitigation techniques exist, optical linewidth broadening through external phase modulation using white noise is predominantly used for its simplicity. But the broadened line-shape is non-ideal and has a slow roll-off resulting in increased SBS seeding from reflections and hence limited power scaling. With better line-shape control, higher output powers can be achieved. In this work, we propose a simple and effective technique to improve the SBS suppression of these high power, narrow linewidth, noise broadened systems, by the addition of a sinusoidal modulation in cascade. The dual modulation results in an improved line-shape with a relatively flat topped-center and fast roll-off when compared to pure noise modulation at similar root-mean-square (RMS) linewidths. Using a multi-stage fully polarization maintaining, kW-class amplifier, we demonstrate >2.3X enhancement in SBS limited output power when compared to the pure noise modulated case at ∼7.3 GHz and >1.029 kW output power at ∼10.4 GHz RMS linewidth.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3111207","Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology; Department of Science and Technology; Ministry of Science and Technology; SPIE Photonics West, San Francisco, USA; Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534665","Stimulated Brillouin scattering;phase modulation;white noise source;sinusoidal modulation;high power fiber lasers;narrow linewidth;power scaling;kilo-watt class","Scattering;Modulation;Power generation;Phase modulation;Power amplifiers;Power lasers;Optical fiber polarization","","9","","30","CCBY","9 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The integration of electricity and gas systems (IEGS), with carbon capture power plants and power-to-gas (CCPP-P2G) facilities, can facilitate flexible dispatching of multiple energy sources. This integration is conducive to the low-carbon and economically efficient operation of IEGS. Current researches did not comprehensively consider the emission mitigation responsibility of the source-demand side. A bi-layer decentralized low-carbon optimal dispatching model on both source and demand sides is proposed in this paper. On the demand side, the carbon emissions and carbon caps are allocated based on marginal carbon intensity, and then a low-carbon demand response mechanism considering step-based carbon price is established to explore the low-carbon potentials of electrical and natural gas loads. An optimal dispatching model, incorporating carbon emission constraints, is formulated on the source side through the analysis of the operational characteristics of CCPP-P2G. Furthermore, the decentralized Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed to solve the bi-layer optimal model while protecting the data privacy of both IEGS operators and users. Case studies validate the environmental and economic benefits of the proposed low-carbon dispatching model.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2021.08790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10520032","Integrated electricity-gas system;carbon emission;demand response;coordinated optimization on the source-demand side;decentralized algorithm","Carbon dioxide;Dispatching;Electricity;Wind power generation;Load modeling;Costs;Carbon","","","","","","3 May 2024","","","CSEE","CSEE Early Access Articles"
