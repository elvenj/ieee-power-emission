Recently, data-driven approaches - motivated by modern machine learning techniques - have been proposed for optical communications in place of traditional model-based counterparts. In particular, the application of neural networks (NN) allows improving the performance of complex modern fiber-optic systems without relying on any a priori knowledge of their specific parameters. In this work, we introduce a novel design of complex-valued NN for optical systems and examine its performance in standard single mode fiber (SSMF) and large effective-area fiber (LEAF) links operating in relatively high nonlinear regime. First, we present a methodology to design a new type of NN based on the assumption that the channel model is more accurate in the nonlinear regime. Second, we implement a Bayesian optimizer to jointly adapt the size of the NN and its number of input taps depending on the different fiber properties and total length. Finally, the proposed NN is numerically and experimentally validated showing an improvement of 1.7 dB in the linear regime, 2.04 dB at the optimal optical power and 2.61 at the max available power on Q-factor when transmitting a WDM 30 × 200G DP-16QAM signal over a 612 km SSMF legacy link. The results highlight that the NN is able to mitigate not only part of the nonlinear impairments caused by optical fiber propagation but also imperfections resulting from using low-cost legacy transceiver components, such as digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and Mach-Zehnder modulator.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2020.3042414","EU H2020 Program under the Marie Skodowska-Curie(grant numbers:766115,813144); Leverhulme Trust(grant numbers:RP-2018-063); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9280329","Neural network;nonlinear equalizer;channel model;metropolitan links;Bayesian optimizer;coherent detection","Artificial neural networks;Optical fiber communication;Optical distortion;Optical polarization;Neurons;Mathematical model;Nonlinear distortion","","45","","35","IEEE","3 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two supercapacitor banks are employed in the DC microgrids as integrated energy storage. With the microgrids, three operating modes which are available in DC vessels with integrated energy storage are experimentally demonstrated: load leveling - keeping generator loads within generator's optimal operating ranges and minimising a number of running generators by charging energy for light load and discharging it for overload, transient mitigation - improving transient system performance and reducing transient engine emissions by fast-response energy storage systems, and zero emission - shutting down onboard generators while in a port with electrical power supply from energy storage systems or onshore power grids. Furthermore, potential benefits of the above ship operating modes are discussed from the experimental test results.

This requires a need of computer model to analyze them. These models (financial, economic, or etc.) often employ scenario analysis to investigate different assumptions about the technical and economical conditions at play. Hence, a large number of software tools, techniques and modeling approaches are used, some better than the other. A wide range of techniques are employed, ranging from broadly economic to broadly engineering. Mathematical optimization is often used to determine the least-cost in some sense. Models can be international, regional, national, municipal, or stand-alone in scope. However, the choice of a suitable model is highly complex since a wrong choice will cost industry a significant amount of time and money only to end up with some inaccurate or wrong results. The initial part of this study analyze different approaches for energy modeling and which software tool will be most feasible to use under those conditions. The outputs from these models may include the system feasibility, greenhouse gas emissions, cumulative financial costs, natural resource use, and energy efficiency of the system under investigation. Hence, even after careful selection of a modeling tool, the interpretation of output data is still a complex task since it requires handling a large amount of data. Thus, the second part of this study deals with business intelligence tools that can be used to handle and properly interpret that data. Especially in the context of scenario based modeling, these tools can provide graphical representation of different dynamics just by using simple clicks once the model is ready. This analysis will help industries and R&D departments through performing better assessments and ease of data handling.","","978-1-7281-5149-6","10.1109/ICEEST48626.2019.8981691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8981691","Energy Assessment;Scenario based Modeling;Business Intelligence;Technology Innovation","Biological system modeling;Tools;Mathematical model;Analytical models;Optimization;Data models;Business intelligence","","","","20","IEEE","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, there has been an upsurge in the uptake of solar and wind resources in South Africa. However, as VRE sources depend on meteorological conditions, it is anticipated that VRE sources are likely to be affected by CC. This paper seeks to establish whether there are historic trends in solar and wind resource availability and variability in South Africa that can be attributed to CC. Understanding the shifts in resource potential would aid policy makers and network planners in optimally selecting and siting future VRE generators. A trend analysis was conducted using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset spanning the period from 1951 to 2020. Results indicated that the summer season has shown significant declining trends in solar and wind energy resource. Generally, in areas with good resource potential, less significant changes were observed compared to areas with poorer resource potential, which showed stronger decreasing trends along with increased variability. It is recommended that further analyses be conducted using climate projections to assess future resource shifts and changes to underlying patterns of variability.","","978-1-6654-5505-3","10.1109/UPEC55022.2022.9917826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9917826","climate change;variable renewable energy;resource assessment","Renewable energy sources;Climate change;Power engineering;Wind energy;Carbon dioxide;Market research;Generators","","1","","23","IEEE","18 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many of them have already been overcome, and many more need to be addressed. In emerging networks such as 5G and beyond, the bandwidth, latency, Jitter, and fidelity demands on fronthaul networks result in significant challenges to the RoF schemes. Furthermore, the movement from the lower microwave region to the mm-wave region was straight forward advantageous for wireless operations in terms of bandwidth. However, this movement imposes more challenges on RoF deployment because the combination of wireless and wired (Fiber) networks in one infrastructure is a difficult task and challenging.

The authors of the present article previously developed a systematic method to isolate CM behavior of an arbitrary system through the decomposition of the mixed-mode system description into CM equivalent model (CEM). In the current study, this approach is applied to the boost converter topology. The accompanying analysis identifies the elements of greatest importance to the CM behavior of this topology, and provides new insight into the influence of the filter inductor configuration on the conducted emissions profile of this system. The developed CEM is validated through a set of empirical studies that also corroborate the emissions trends predicted by the CEM.

Robust optical communications links are compulsory to be able to follow this growing demand for high-speed downlink with targets ranging from 10Gbps to 1Tbps. Atmospheric turbulences compensation is a key element to achieve such throughput. Here we investigate the capacity of turbulence mitigation via the use of a MPLC followed by an active optical recombiner, also called Tilba-Atmo. The MPLC demultiplexes the incoming turbulent beam into a set of gaussians beams whose relative energy distribution and relative phase evolves according to turbulence fluctuations. These gaussians are then sent into an active system based on a photonic integrated chip where the channels are optically recombined two-by-two in separate Mach-Zehnder interferometers. An 8-HGmode MPLC was placed at the reception end of a free space optical link in C or L-band. Different configurations where tried such as different levels of turbulence. Two different link lengths were tested, a 200m link with a 20cm telescope and a 10 km link at the DLR with a 10cm telescope which is normally use for testing and developing adaptive optics solutions. The first link showed high level of phase degradation on the received beam whilst on the second link the main effect of atmospheric turbulence was scintillation inside the pupil. In both cases tip-tilt was compensated via an auxiliary system and was not implemented inside the Tilba-Atmo component. The results are focused on comparison of fading in CW condition and in OOK communication between an SMF channel and the Tilba-Atmo channel. As this first version Tilba-Atmo is contributing to optical losses and optical recombining might be limited by the control electronics, a numerical sum of the demultiplexed modes is also performed to determine the upper limits of such a system.","","978-1-6654-3439-3","10.1109/ICSOS53063.2022.9749710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9749710","Laser Communication;Multi-Plane Light Conversion;Atmospheric turbulence;Free-Space Optical Communication","Optical fibers;Integrated optics;Fading channels;Optical fiber sensors;Optical interferometry;Spontaneous emission;Optical distortion","","2","","9","IEEE","11 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the most ubiquitous design is the plate-fin heatsink, but this design is not ideal for EMI emissions. The novel design that replaces the plate-fins utilize LC (inductor-capacitor) resonances with a coil-like structure.

However, the throughput and average spectral efficiency (ASE) of the system may decrease due to the inter-cell interference and the inter-user interference, particularly for the indoor environment, where the LEDs are densely deployed in the case of multiple users. To suppress such interference, we introduce innovatively the improved tabu search (TS) algorithm into the frequency reuse in the multi-user VLC networks. We propose a bidirectional double tabu list strategy to avoid getting trapped in the situation of the local optimum. In addition, we design the evaluation function and aspiration criterion of the algorithm. We employ the improved TS algorithm to find the optical dynamic frequency reuse scheme by combining the interference graph. The interference graph is used to determine the interference relationships and to construct the solutions to the algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme effectively improves the throughput and the ASE of the system without lowering the fairness performance, especially in the scenario of numerous users.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2902126","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61275077); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8654597","Visible light communication (VLC);frequency reuse;interference mitigation;tabu search;interference graph","Interference;Light emitting diodes;Heuristic algorithms;Optical transmitters;Throughput;Spectral efficiency;Visible light communication","","14","","26","OAPA","28 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Reducing our carbon footprint is becoming a necessity as natural resources are depleted faster than they are created. However, some protocols intended to improve the safety of the industry have resulted with unintentional consequences. In 2014, diesel-powered ground support equipment, used to support flight operations, began utilizing diesel emissions control systems to improve air quality and reduce emissions for ground service providers. Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) effectively reduces the emissions of the two most critical components of diesel exhaust, particulates and NOx. While DEF is effective at reducing pollution, it has also been the subject of several contamination incidents that have led to inflight emergencies. DEF is a colorless liquid, similar to fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII). In all three incidents, DEF was confused with FSII and inadvertently added to aviation fuel which was then pumped into the aircraft. While none of these incidents resulted with catastrophic outcomes, the potential for such an event is clear. In 2019 an industry working group was established to perform a safety risk assessment and propose recommendations for mitigating this hazard. While each of these incidents was thoroughly investigated the recommendations provided were broad, high-level, and general in nature. Recognizing the need for additional research which examined the underlying organizational and environmental factors, the authors considered these elements in light of the recommended strategies proposed by the working group. It was found that a proactive and reactive approach to mitigating human error was needed to minimize the potential for jet fuel contamination. A learner-centered approach to training that accounts for generational differences and levels of expertise, combined with a hazard reporting tool that proactively identifies potential DEF contamination hazards both have the potential to minimize the occurrence of human error in jet fuel contamination.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438524","","Industries;Training;Protocols;Pollution;Liquids;Tools;Hazards","","","","20","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional ANC headphone, being one of the mature commercial products that implement this approach, utilizes microphones on its earcup to pick up the reference signal. However, in a multi-noise source situation, the reference signal mixed with uncorrelated interference usually results in poor noise reduction performance of the ANC system. Hence, we proposed a novel hybrid approach that employs wireless microphones to acquire high signal-to-noise-ratio reference signals from far-end noise sources, increasing coherence and thus improving noise reduction performance. Additionally, an error separation model is applied in the proposed structure to enhance the coherence between the error signal and each adaptive filter. As a result, the proposed hybrid approach to combine wireless and earcup microphones for ANC headphone significantly improves its noise reduction performance when dealing with multi-noise sources. Furthermore, numerical simulation and real-time experiments of the proposed structure have shown that it improves noise reduction performance by 4 − 6 dB when compared to a conventional ANC headphone.","2379-190X","978-1-6654-0540-9","10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9747890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9747890","Active noise control (ANC);wireless ANC;error separation module","Headphones;Wireless communication;Noise reduction;Adaptive filters;Interference;Coherence;Numerical simulation","","2","","28","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tracks are still dominated by noisy cars braked with metal brake blocks, which in the course of passage cause several times higher noise than modern cars with non-metallic brakes. Although these are the technical parameters that determine the noise level of a train, it is not possible to find out of any registry the proportion of obsolete noisy vehicles on tracks. The long-term objective of the project is to identify individual problematic trains in terms of noise. In cooperation with national railroad authority, a system has been developed that utilizes the CESVA TA120 measuring sensor network and is designed to provide to the railroad operator, in addition to all the train parameters that can be traced (carrier, time, weight, length, number of vehicles and axles, video recordings) other essential information about the passing train - sound exposure level of the train pass. The plan is to build a sensor network using the existing infrastructure so that a detailed overview of the noise level of each single freight train can be obtained.","","978-1-7281-4925-7","10.1109/ICTEP48662.2019.8969003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8969003","","","","1","","1","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
