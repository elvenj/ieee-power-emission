"The Co-benefits of Renewable Energy Policies in Japan: Barriers and Ways Forward","T. Etsujiro","Sustainable Governance Center, Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, Japan","2020 International Conference and Utility Exhibition on Energy, Environment and Climate Change (ICUE)","11 Jan 2021","2020","","","1","6","In recent years, many counties have intensified efforts to address the climate emergency. In Japan, these efforts have often built upon policies and plans to promote renewable energy that followed the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Further many of these policies and plans deliver important benefits beyond mitigating climate change such as reductions in air pollution. Achieving these benefits will require both a clear understanding of the magnitude of co-benefits and strategies for overcoming barriers to achieving them. The main purpose of this paper is to describe the policies that can deliver co-benefits from renewable energy in Japan; analyze the technical, social and political barriers to implementing those policies; present a simple method for quantifying co-benefits from those policies; and underline how a concept called Regional Circulating and Ecological Sphere (CES) can provide a useful framework for moving past key barriers.","","978-1-7281-8334-3","10.1109/ICUE49301.2020.9306987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9306987","Co-benefits;Energy Policy in Japan;Regional Circular and Ecological Sphere;Regional Revitalization;Renewable Energy","Renewable energy sources;Power generation;Wind power generation;Solar power generation;Government;Climate change;Power systems","","1","","14","IEEE","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study examines the potential of integrating PV systems into reference European distribution grids for 2030 and 2050. Optimal energy mix modelling is used to determine PV power penetration levels, and a stochastic approach is used to assess the hosting capacity of PV systems in three reference European distribution grids, considering scenarios with only PV system increases and with PV and energy storage system (ESS) installations. Results show that some countries that rely solely on PV system installations will reach the upper limits of PV power penetration by 2030, but implementing ESS or other smart techniques can exceed these limits by 2050. This analysis emphasizes the importance of strategic planning and mitigation measures to accommodate the expected increase in PV generation and optimize grid performance.","","978-88-87237-60-3","10.23919/AEIT60520.2023.10330335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10330335","Photovoltaic System;Hosting capacity;Energy Storage System;Power Flows;Simulations","Photovoltaic systems;Renewable energy sources;Europe;Stochastic processes;Strategic planning;Thermal management;Stakeholders","","","","25","","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of electrical energy is increasing day by day and therefore it is important to plan a future power system well in advance to meet the expected demand growth with a reasonable reliability level at minimum cost. Nowadays, renewable power generation plays an important role in power generation since, it is pollution free and zero fuel cost. In this paper an effort is made to project a future power system for Assam, an Indian state. In the present power systems, the electricity is generated mainly from non-renewable energy sources which increase greenhouse gases (GHG) emission and hence global warming. Keeping in mind about pollution impacts, renewable energy sources like wind, solar, biomass for the planning a future power system of Assam using long range energy alternative planning system (LEAP) software is considered. The proposed capacity expansion is planned for next twelve years from 2019 to 2030. In this work, the various scenarios developed separately with LEAP are Greenhouse gas mitigation scenario, Low demand growth and High demand growth scenarios. In addition to these, reference scenario has also been considered. In all these scenarios the system installed capacity and one-hundred-year global warming potential have been investigated quantitatively.","","978-1-6654-2506-3","10.1109/APSIT52773.2021.9641203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9641203","Capacity Expansion Planning;Demand growth;Global Warming Potential;LEAP;RES component;formatting;style;styling","Measurement;Pollution;Costs;Greenhouse effect;Wind energy;Global warming;Software","","","","6","IEEE","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Energy systems consist of many components that are closely related to socio-economic development and resources conservation with multiple criteria and objectives. These components may be interrelated to each other and may present uncertain and dynamic features, associated with spatial heterogeneity, implying issues of system reliability and economic/environmental effects. Effective systems planning and policy-making support are desired for the long-term energy-environment management. In this study, eight representative regions in Canada with typical energy-related issues are identified and analyzed. A set of mathematical algorithms are integrated into the regional energy model framework to tackled uncertainties. Tradeoffs between environmental goals, economic benefits, and energy development in these regions can be reflected.

Its incorporation has resulted in game-changing advantages such as increased RES reliability, improved environmental conditions, supportive energy-generation mix, and so on. Nonetheless, Malaysia's energy storage market is dominated by battery energy storage systems (BESS), which has resulted in several problems, namely its massive carbon footprint and high cost, leading to the discovery of renewable energy storage systems (RESS). This study focuses on studying the benefits and challenges of gravity energy storage systems (GESS) in comparison to BESS. The GESS is a recently developed technology in the RESS industry. Even though it is still in the research and development stage, experts are optimistic about its potential benefits in storing unprecedentedly enormous amounts of electricity. The type of GESS studied in this research is the underground GESS with suspended weights (SGESS) which stores/generates energy by lifting/dispatching weights in a (500 – 5000) m shaft. The research findings supported GESS by demonstrating a surprising cost-effective conclusion when utilizing unused mines within Malaysia with no drilling required, rounding to a 2786 MYR (664 USD) Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), compared to BESS high LCOE of 7.2 MM MYR (1.72 MM USD) to store energy at the same community scale. Other benefits include lower operating and maintenance costs, less environmental damage, and a greater depth of discharge, to name a few, concluding this research by labeling GESS the most cost-effective, efficient, and environmentally friendly alternative to BESS.","","978-1-6654-8592-0","10.1109/PECCON55017.2022.9851072","Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9851072","Battery Energy Storage System (BESS);Gravity Energy Storage System (GESS);Renewable Energy Storage Systems (RESS);Community Energy Storage (CES);Lithium-Ion Battery","Shafts;Renewable energy sources;Costs;Power engineering computing;Batteries;Fuel processing industries;Reliability","","1","","28","IEEE","16 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These EVs are charged from the electric power system, usually at distribution networks which presents a challenge to distribution networks. This paper presents a study for mitigating the impacts of uncontrolled EV charging on low voltage (LV) distribution network supplying commercial consumers. For this purpose, decentralized photovoltaic (PV) generation is used. This study takes into account the current status of the distribution networks where there is no communication infrastructure or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) devices present in the grid, neither is there a control center. Therefore, there is no coordination between the EV charging and PV generation. The transformer loading, cable loading, voltage profile at the furthest point from the transformer and daily energy losses are investigated for three operation scenarios. The first scenario is the original state (base case) of the LV distribution network which supplies only commercial consumers, and neither EVs nor PV generation is connected to it. In the second scenario EVs are connected to the network for charging. In the third scenario EVs are connected to the network for charging and PV generation is available. The study is performed using DIgSILENT Power Factory software. 24-hour time series simulations are executed with a load flow every 15 minutes. The results demonstrate that the decentralized PV generation can alleviate the impacts of uncontrolled EV charging on commercial LV distribution network.","","978-1-5386-5261-9","10.1109/ITCE.2019.8646632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8646632","uncontrolled charging;distribution network;photovoltaic;electric vehicles","Loading;Power cables;Energy loss;Electric vehicle charging;Solar power generation;Buildings","","12","","12","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research aims to establish initial upper and lower bounds of the data management emissions for A V operation.

Whilst the energy is traded among distributed prosumers, the carbon responsibilities and corresponding allowances trading need to be transferred from large-scale energy suppliers to prosumers. During this transformation, the issues of energy imbalance, carbon reduction imbalance, and residential privacy leakage in centralised trading market present serious challenges. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralised blockchain-based peer-to-peer trading scheme coupling energy and carbon markets. We implement pay-to-public-key-hash with multiple signatures as a transaction standard to realise a more secure transaction and reduced storage burden of senders.

The environmental benefits of EVs motivate more consumers to adopt EVs which leads to a major rise in the demand for EVs. To meet the rising demand there is a need for considerable EV charging stations. These EV charging stations when connected to the grid, inject harmonic, disturb the voltage and ultimately hamper the power quality (PQ) of the utility. In this paper, the impact of EV charging stations on the PQ of the utility grids is analyzed. The concerns like voltage sag and swell, harmonics, and power demand are observed and a mitigation technique is provided for improving the PQ of the utility.","","978-1-6654-9501-1","10.1109/DASA54658.2022.9765054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9765054","EV’s;EV Charging Stations;harmonics;PQ;voltage sag;voltage swell","Integrated circuits;Voltage fluctuations;Roads;Power quality;Charging stations;Harmonic analysis;Electric vehicle charging","","12","","15","IEEE","2 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among them, harmonic emission is the most significant challenge to be overcome by the distribution networks. Unwanted current, overheating motors and transformers, equipment failure, and circuit breaker misoperation are some of the harmonic consequences. While it is important to employ the best methods to mitigate or suppress the harmonic distortions in power systems, it is even more essential to estimate these harmonics at the outset by developing smart, efficient, and accurate techniques. Due to their capability for learning, predicting, and identifying, researchers have turned to Artificial Intelligence technologies for harmonic estimation in distribution networks. Although the power system parameters (impedance/admittance model) and many harmonic monitors are prerequisites for traditional harmonic estimation methods, by utilizing Artificial Intelligence, these requirements are minimized. In this paper, a comprehensive review of traditional and modern (smart) harmonic estimation techniques are discussed.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3260768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10078390","Power quality;harmonic distortion;artificial intelligence;machine learning;neural network;power systems;harmonic estimation;harmonic mitigation","Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters;Inverters;Power quality;Harmonic distortion;Impedance;Estimation","","7","","95","CCBYNCND","22 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, RES are intermittent in nature and the power generated by them fluctuates randomly, due to which, appropriate measures are needed to ensure an efficient and reliable power supply. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art techniques used to mitigate the intermittency of RES in MG. A new classification of intermittency mitigation techniques is presented and a comparison of these techniques is drawn. Based on the reviewed literature, some important research directions to improve the existing intermittency mitigation techniques are proposed. Among these directions, the need to investigate RES complementarity further by characterizing RES, minimization of the cost of energy storage systems (ESS) and development of algorithms for better integration, management and control of ESS and dispatchable generators have been identified as crucial challenges in mitigating the intermittency of RES in MG. In addition, the standardization of communication protocols to ensure interoperability of communicating elements of MG and the use of fast, reliable communication links have been realized as fundamental requirements for a MG to be able to mitigate intermittency through appropriate techniques, such as, energy cooperation between MG and demand response management.","","978-1-7281-6021-4","10.1109/ICGEA49367.2020.239699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9077559","renewable energy sources;microgrids;intermittency;complementarity;energy storage systems","","","8","","30","IEEE","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The solution of the model determines the optimal radial topology, the operation of switchable capacitor banks, and the operation of dispatchable and non dispatchable distributed generators. A stochastic scenario-based model is considered to handle uncertainties in load behavior, solar irradiation, and energy prices. The optimal solution of this model can be reached with a commercial solver; however, this is not computationally efficient. To tackle this issue a novel methodology which explores the efficiency of classical optimization techniques and heuristic based on neighborhood structures, referred as matheuristic algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm. the neighborhood search is carried out using the solution of reduced MISOCP models that are obtained from the original formulation of the problem. Numerical experiments are performed using several systems to compare the performance of the proposed matheuristic against the direct solution by the commercial solver CPLEX. Results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methodology solving the problem for large-scale systems.","","978-1-6654-3613-7","10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope51590.2021.9584762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584762","CO2 emissions mitigation;distribution systems reconfiguration;matheuristic;mixed-integer second-order conic programming;neighborhood search","Radiation effects;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Stochastic processes;Switches;Programming;Search problems","","5","","20","IEEE","3 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simultaneously, the integration of renewables, mainly solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, for on-site electricity generation is one of the most promising mitigation strategies against climate change. However, the design and the performance evaluation of these buildings and their energy systems are strongly dependent on the climatic conditions of the site and must also take into account climate change effects. On that premise, the aim of this study is to assess the impact of climate change on the cooling energy consumption and photovoltaic energy production of a representative classroom building in Mogadishu, Somalia. To conduct such analysis, the reference building has been modeled at different indoor conditions, for present (TMY) and future climates (Shared Socio-Economic Pathways of the IPCC AR6). Results indicated that higher indoor temperature/humidity setpoint combined with ceiling fans reduce the energy consumption for cooling by 19% compared to standard conditions in the present climate and will be able to mitigate the effects of warmer future climate even in the worst-case scenario. On the other hand, higher indoor conditions also proved to increase the renewable energy ratio of the building compared to standard conditions in present climate and will reduce the need for increasing the PV power output in future climatic conditions.","2474-9664","979-8-3503-4837-8","10.1109/ICCEP57914.2023.10247470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10247470","Air Conditioning;Climate Change;Cooling;PV energy;SDG7;SDG13","Photovoltaic systems;Energy consumption;Climate change;Renewable energy sources;Fans;Cooling;Buildings","","","","32","IEEE","13 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The latter are flexible, energy-efficient urban areas or groups of buildings that produce zero net CO2 emissions and actively manage annual renewable energy surplus production at the local or regional level. As they are connected to the electric power system, Positive Energy Districts have the ability to offer flexibility services to the grid, such as frequency or voltage regulation, being part of a larger scheme as the Italian energy communities recently regulated by the Milleproroghe Decree.
