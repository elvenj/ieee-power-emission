In this study, a thematic analysis was conducted to examine the role of nuclear fusion facility’s cybersecurity in combating climate change. Findings from our analysis suggest that the cybersecurity of nuclear fusion plants is critical for a reliable and continuous production of clean energy, which is essential for meeting global climate goals. There are publicly available historical facts that suggest that cyberattacks on critical infrastructure can lead to a very negative outcome. Therefore, a cyberattack on any nuclear fusion plants is likely to disrupt the supply of clean energy and may undermine efforts to combat climate change. Ensuring the cybersecurity of nuclear fusion plants requires the development and implementation of robust cybersecurity technologies, standards, and best practices. Investment in cybersecurity startups may also play a role in enhancing a sustainable cybersecurity of nuclear fusion plant. Many studies validate that cybersecurity startups often drive innovation and can bring new and advanced technologies and solutions to the market, which can help to improve the cybersecurity of nuclear fusion plants or other critical infrastructure. This study also echoes the importance of classifying critical infrastructure cybersecurity risks according to either severity level or likelihood to happen. This risks’ classification efforts may include identifying critical assets, assessing vulnerabilities and threats, with the objective to ensure continuous risk assessment is accomplished. In conclusion, this thematic analysis highlights the importance of nuclear fusion plants’ cybersecurity in combating climate change.","","979-8-3503-2922-3","10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom59178.2023.00170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10491822","Critical Infrastructure;Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity;Climate Change;Cybersecurity Practices;Cybersecurity Startups;Managing Cybersecurity Risks;Security in Nuclear Fusion Plants","Critical infrastructure;Climate change;Computer security;Risk management;Nuclear power generation;Green energy","","","","119","IEEE","11 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To have highly efficient MWP system, factors such as dispersion, losses and nonlinearities in the transmission process need to be minimized. Transmission systems generally have non-linearities such as Self-phase modulation (SPM), Cross phase modulation (XPM), Four wave mixing (FWM) which hamper the overall transmission performance at high speeds. To compensate the losses and non-linearities, the system should have right amplification and mitigation mechanism at receiving end. This paper firstly analyses all three non-linearities variation in terms of input power, Fiber length and transmission rate. Secondly, these non-linearities are analyzed with different optical amplifiers such as EDFA black box, Er-Yb co-dopped and Raman amplifiers.

Discount rate is used to determine the present value of future cash flows of the projects. For climate change projects, the lower discount rates are recommended since benefits will be obtained in the long term. In general, private and external costs are used to evaluate the project investment. Combination of both costs is called “social cost”. In this study, only the “social cost of carbon (SCC)”, referring to an estimate of the economic costs of one additional ton of carbon dioxide emitting into the atmosphere, is considered. The objective of this paper is to estimate the SCC in term of carbon tax on the subject of three discount rates with the objective of renewable electricity to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Firstly, a 6 percent discount is applied from the base year to 2037. Then, a discount of 3 percent is applied until 2050. The results show that renewable electricity can achieve the carbon neutrality target at SCC of higher than 2.0 USD/t-CO2 and 132.7 USD/t-CO2 for the periods 2020-2037and 2038–2050, respectively.","","979-8-3503-3326-8","10.1109/ICUE55325.2022.10113526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113526","AIM/EndUse;Carbon neutrality and Climate Change Mitigation;Discount Rate;Social Cost of Carbon;Thailand","Renewable energy sources;Climate change;Costs;Atmosphere;Carbon neutral;Appraisal;Carbon;Climate change","","","","35","IEEE","4 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A metamaterial frequency selective absorber is developed to exhibit the target surface impedance for the wave impedance by finding an equivalent bulk material. It is shown that the most effective absorber in near field should conjugate match to the wave impedance at that location. To demonstrate the validity of this approach, the radiated electric fields leaked outside the system box with various material lining its top wall, from copper to the proposed metamaterial design are calculated using fullwave simulations.

Hence, the overall efficiency of the system is strongly dependent on the efficiency of the power converter.

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters are generally used with converters to meet the standards. These EMI filters are heavy, expensive, and space consuming. A dithering technique of switching frequency has been proposed in this article to reduce the conducted EMI. The proposed technique accurately predetermines the exact reduction of noise. This article also illustrates the problem of resolution bandwidth (RBW) in power electronics applications while measuring the noise. Thus, the present article also suggests a modified dithering technique to overcome this problem. Experimental results are presented at different RBW in the present article. The proposed dithering technique and its modification have been validated through a SiC mosfet-based voltage source inverter fed drive. This article also focuses on the advantages of reducing common mode choke and dc bus capacitance, which eventually saves space and cost for the entire converter system.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2023.3327258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10294198","Dithering;electromagnetic compatibility (EMC);electromagnetic interference (EMI);resolution bandwidth (RBW);SiC mosfet;switching frequency level;voltage source inverter (VSI)","Power harmonic filters;Switching frequency;Passive filters;Inverters;Electromagnetic interference;Frequency modulation;Standards","","","","29","IEEE","24 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, PV systems are susceptible to operational and environmental stresses. Moreover, PV panels monitoring is necessary to keep their performance and efficiency intact due to their lack of supervisory control. Therefore, this study monitors PV panels based on health into three sub-classes: healthy, hotspot, and faulty through infrared thermography. First, Thermographs key points are selected using an  $8\times 8$  uniform pixel grid, and speed-up robust features (SURF) are extracted from grid intersection points. Afterward, due to its simplicity, the k-mean clustering algorithm creates single-level clusters based on actual observations similarities and similar observations closeness within-cluster and dissimilarity to other clusters observations are used to transform features into visual words. Finally, shallow classifiers are utilized because of low training time and high prediction speed. After extensive testing and compressive analysis, the proposed approach was found economical, fast, and showed high testing accuracy of 97% through a multi-class shallow classifier (support vector machine) with low computational complexity and less storage size. Thus, this approach can monitor megawatt PV systems with high accuracy and keep performance and emissions mitigation potential high while lowering payback time.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3148138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698239","Visual vocabulary;photovoltaic (PV) system healthy;hotspot","Feature extraction;Monitoring;Stress;Fault diagnosis;Manuals;Circuit faults;Birds","","5","","29","CCBY","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is important to make sure that it contributes or at least does not act inhibitory in any of the three dimensions of sustainability. This study examines the potential of demand-side management and electrified cooking as sustainable solutions for off-grid electricity in Bangladesh. The evaluation is based on techno-economic, environmental, and social aspects, using a set of selected indicators. The study employs two tools, RAMP and MicroGridsPy, to optimize techno-economic results. The environmental evaluations are based on the result of the techno-economic evaluation and literature review, while the social aspect evaluations are based on the literature review and the author's own remarks and experiences. The analysis is completed using a sustainability matrix in the form of a simplified multi-criteria analysis. This study investigates the impact of peak shaving by fans and TVs and the introduction of electrified cooking in an off-grid electrification system. In Bangladesh, both approaches have positive economic and environmental impacts, but peak shaving has a negative social impact. The study finds that the result can contribute to sustainable development of off-grid electricity system in Bangladesh.","","979-8-3503-3755-6","10.1109/PowerAfrica57932.2023.10363250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10363250","Demand side management;Electrified cooking;Solar power;Sustain ability","Economics;Fans;Electric potential;TV;Demand side management;Bibliographies;Sustainable development","","1","","35","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A radical change in the behavior of humanity is thus needed urgently. One of the major challenges is to replace our current energy systems with sustainable systems in the face of environmental degradation. For this purpose, and as part of the European initiatives, the Covenant of Mayors is enabling municipalities, cities and regions to carry out actions in the fields of energy and climate. In this framework, a newly-developed tool, the SECAP-SSP or Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan–Self Sufficient Program, is applied by the Municipality of Hammana-Lebanon (standard process) in order to design its Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP) and ensure compliance with the Covenant of Mayors. This case study has resulted in a broad understanding of how to use this tool, or even to show that SECAP-SSP has greatly simplified the task compared to the conventional tools that have been used before. It should be noted that SECAP-SSP can be applied by any municipality in Lebanon and can be extended to suit the South-Mediterranean context. Every authority could create its “SECAP” space online. The various human activities in all sectors (residential, tertiary, industry, transportation, agriculture, electricity generation, etc.) involving energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions are the specific data that the user must enter. The structure of the software facilitates the work to be done in each sector. Other data on climate, the availability of renewable energy and the current price of fossil fuels are provided by the tool. Indicators (economic, environmental and potential) to achieve optimization are calculated by the tool. In the end, SECAP-SSP established a Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) for the authority as well as it suggested the SECAP, feasible and profitable both economically and environmentally.","2644-1837","978-1-7281-5595-1","10.1109/REDEC49234.2020.9163852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9163852","Sustainable energy and climate action plan;Emission inventory;Greenhouse gases reduction;Mitigation;Covenant of mayors","Meteorology;Climate change;Buildings;Energy consumption;Local government;Production;Agriculture;Sustainable development;Greenhouse effect","","","","10","IEEE","11 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Maintaining adequate power supplies and flourishing fish populations hangs on the balance of managing the tradeoffs of water resource management. Aside from energy adequacy, substituting hydropower with other renewable energy sources impacts the overall energy dispatch behavior of the grid, including emissions of existing fossil fuels. This study extends earlier work in the literature to evaluate the adequacy impact to the power supply by removing four Lower Snake River dams in the Columbia River Basin in favor of supporting migratory salmon populations. The authors explore the climate performance, i.e., fossil fuel dispatch changes, of simulated renewable substitution portfolios to supplement performance metrics alongside adequacy and initial investment metrics. The study finds that including the climate metric greatly influences the favorability of some alternative portfolios that would otherwise be overlooked, with some portfolios improving climate mitigation efforts by reducing emissions over the baseline scenario. The contribution is in advancing a straightforward and supplementary climate performance method that can accompany any energy portfolio analysis.","","978-1-6654-3771-4","10.1109/IEEM50564.2021.9672812","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1804560); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9672812","Food-energy-water nexus;dam removal;climate change;regional energy planning","Measurement;Renewable energy sources;Dams;Sociology;Fossil fuels;Rivers;Statistics","","1","","35","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Implementation of integrated solution to get sustainable control system has significant challenges. Acceptance of the key precautions and maintenance of sustainability became a bottleneck. The consequence of human social activities increases the consumption of fossil fuels as power resources which indirectly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases and water vapor, in the environment. This causes the earth's average surface temperature to increase. Water vapor is responsible for two-thirds of this issue; however, C02 is proven to be the key factor of global warming. The global temperature could have increased to 3.8 o C in case C02 concentration was doubled. The trend and association between rising temperatures and C02 emissions are shown in this work, along with an explanation of the many methods behind ideal mitigation. One of the goals of this research is to identify the issue area and integrate the climatic data. This will assist in obtaining a dependable control system capable of addressing global warming concerns.
