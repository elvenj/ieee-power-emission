This is owing to the global commitment to decelerate global warming, reduce greenhouse gas emission and avoid environmental pollution by cutting down fossil fuel-based generation to the barest minimum. Solar energy generation as an alternative is one of the most common renewable energy generation technologies in the world today. The technology however, has its setbacks and requires constant maintenance in order to maintain high generation efficiency and avoid faults and generation downtime. This study reviews the strategies and methods for mitigating the various faults associated with solar photovoltaic systems.

In this article, the CCF estimation problem is formulated and a novel estimation methodology is proposed for the first time to estimate the direct and indirect carbon emissions of factories in real time. An appliance identification method based on the multihead self-attention mechanism and gated recurrent unit is proposed to identify the device states, and then, calculate the corresponding direct carbon emission.

However, the existing international standards (IEC 61000-3-2&12&16 and IEEE Std. 519) list grid harmonic limitations only up to the 40th or 50th harmonic. Due to limited knowledge of supraharmonic (Harmonics above 2 kHz) currents and voltages, an appropriate standard for this high frequency range is yet to be published. This paper presents an analysis of grid current distortion in the frequency range of 2 to 9 kHz when an active front end inverter is connected to the grid under different filter designs. New filter design approach is used to reduce or eliminate harmonics at frequencies beyond the ranges considered in conventional standards. The results show significant mitigation of high frequency harmonics in stiff grids. High frequency harmonic behavior with conventional and newly designed filters connected to a weak grid, are compared to find small amplitude current and voltage harmonics using the new filters. Furthermore, this study highlights the need for a new standard to address supraharmonics caused by grid-tied inverters.","","978-9-0758-1531-3","10.23919/EPE.2019.8914845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8914845","Harmonic distortion;inverter;LCL filter;power quality;supraharmonics","Power harmonic filters;Harmonic analysis;Inverters;Standards;Power system stability","","9","","21","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such modification will converge to the Nash Equilibrium Point (NEP), where each MG cannot obtain more profits by modifying its strategy subject to the fixed strategy of other rival MGs. In this paper, the NEP under such a joint market paradigm is investigated, in which MGs will trade electricity in the EM and purchase carbon emission quotas (CEQs) in the CEAM.

The results show that adequate carbon pricing is an effective measure to reach significant emission reductions with in the power sector through fuel switching from coal to gas. Moreover, the impact of the fuel-switch on emission reductions is highly dependent on the initial relationship of fuel prices for gas and coal given low carbon prices. Conversely the dependency decreases with higher carbon prices. Overall, the marginal benefit of ambitious carbon prices is capped by the capacity utilization of gas-fired power plants. The rate of additional emission mitigation is highest at carbon prices in the range between 50-100€/tCO2, an increase beyond 150 €/tCO2 results in minor further emission reductions.","2165-4093","978-1-7281-1257-2","10.1109/EEM.2019.8916290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8916290","","Carbon dioxide;Power generation;Europe;Carbon;Switches;Coal;Climate change","","1","","23","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The exposure index (EI) is used to characterize the EMF exposure taking in account the power density, specific absorption rate (SAR); using both the electric field strength and magnetic field strength as well as considering the variability of other factors such as environment, the conductivity and the mass density of tissue. This work aims at simulating the radiations emitted from access points (APs) and mobile devices, analyzing and comparing them with the threshold set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) for the understanding of radiation impact. The numerical results reveal that the maximum radiation exposure emitted is far lower than the ICNIRP standard. It is shown that the exposure from mobile devices (uplink) has more EI compared with the ones due with the transmitting stations (downlink) radio emissions, and both can be minimized when there is an optimal power control scheme in the network as revealed in the power density received from the APs.

Various mitigation techniques, such as increasing inner control loop gain, grid voltage feedforward, and selective harmonic compensation, have been adopted in industry to reduce the emissions originating from distorted background voltage. However, although these techniques are effective in suppressing the current at the harmonic orders present in the background voltage, they deteriorate the emission at coupled frequencies. This paper provides the theoretical explanation of this phenomenon, which is verified by simulation of a two-level active front end in PSCAD/EMTDC. This paper also discusses the proper treatment of current emission due to background voltage harmonics.","2377-5483","978-1-5386-9310-0","10.1109/ITEC.2019.8790520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8790520","","Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters;Phase locked loops;Voltage control;Current control;Pulse width modulation;Resonant frequency","","1","","16","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The growth in the amount and diversity of waste substances produced in this society, effects the environment and human health, which in return leads to various illnesses. A comprehensive research was conducted to understand the potential of Waste Materials to Electric power (WtE) especially using non-biodegradable waste like plastics and tins by burning these substances, the heating panel will produce electricity. The WtE concept is a revolutionary approach that may help to reduce the environmental impact for the humans. The WtEplant converts the waste substances into electricity, through heating panel. The electricity generated from the WtE plant may be used to power homes, businesses, and other establishments, reducing the need for traditional electricity from non-renewable sources. The WtE plant also helps to reduce the amount of waste that is sent to landfills. By reducing the amount of waste being sent to landfills, the WtE plant would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases like CO2, CO, SO2, NO2, and heavy metals like mercury being released into the atmosphere. In addition, the WtE plant would also be able to reduce the amount of energy that is needed to transport the waste to and from the landfills.","","979-8-3503-9720-8","10.1109/ICIDCA56705.2023.10099978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099978","Waste Materials to Electric power;Waste to Electricity Plant;Non-Renewable Sources;Greenhouse Gases","Waste management;Waste materials;Production;Tin;Power systems;Waste heat;Plastics","","2","","15","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The building sector accounts for about 40% of global energy consumption and 30% of GHG emissions. This sector must reduce its energy consumption by at least 50% by shifting to hyper-efficient systems and renewable energy to meet the climate change mitigation goal. Certified green buildings are responsible for about 40% of the office markets in the U. S. and utilize the types of strategies that should be implemented by all new construction and major renovations. Certified green buildings, although highly effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are generally considered to be an expensive solution to this problem. There is excellent potential for the construction sector to employ a blockchain framework of measurement, report, and verification (MRV) towards building energy performance (BEP) to enable certified green buildings to earn carbon credits based on their exceptional energy performance. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for intermediaries to validate the data and builds up a reliable, immutable, traceable energy monitoring system. The goal of this paper is to present a new blockchain digital MRV architecture for existing BEP and a prototype of its application.","","978-1-7281-7091-6","10.1109/BRAINS49436.2020.9223302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223302","Blockchain Architecture;Building Energy Performance (BEP);Digital Measurement;Reporting;and Verification (MRV);Carbon Credit","Energy consumption;Renewable energy sources;Green buildings;Architecture;Buildings;Energy measurement;Prototypes;Climate change","","1","","26","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve the conflicting interests over the two timescales, this article: 1) proposes a novel hierarchical optimization model to align with the actual operation paradigms of the hierarchical market, whereby the capacity allocation matrix is adopted to coordinate the DA and balancing markets; 2) mathematically formulates and quantitatively analyses the long-term driving factors of balancing actions, enabling system operators (SOs) to design efficient and well-functioning market structures to meet economic and environmental targets; 3) empowers renewable generating units and flexible loads to participate in the balancing market (BM) as ‘active’ actors and enforces the non-discriminatory provision of balancing services. The performance of the proposed model is validated on a modified IEEE 39-bus power system and a reduced GB network. Results reveal that with effective resource allocation in different timescales of the hierarchical market, the drop speed of balancing costs soars while the intermittent generation climbs. The proposed methodology enables SOs to make the most of all resources available in the market and balance the system flexibly and economically. It thus safeguards the climate mitigation pathways against the risks of substantially higher balancing costs.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3299113","EPSRC Supergen Hub for Energy Networks; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10194978","Balancing market;flexible load;long-term driving factors","Renewable energy sources;Costs;Resource management;Real-time systems;Indexes;Vehicles;Pricing","","","","40","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the large proliferation of wind power generators is causing several critical issues in power systems due to their variable power generated profiles. For this reason, a large number of learning techniques, e.g. integrating Vector Auto-Regressive and Neural Network-based models, were proposed in the literature for mitigating wind power uncertainty issues. Unfortunately, these methodologies show several limitations, e.g. the huge number of parameters and/or the heavy computational cost, which hinder their deployment in modern power system operation, where prompt and reliable wide-area wind power generation forecasts are requested for supporting time-critical decision making on several time horizons. To try addressing this issue, this paper proposes the Dynamic Adaptive Feature-based Temporal Ensemble (DAFT-E) forecasting approach, which relies on an extensive feature engineering, a fast feature selection step and an ensemble of computationally inexpensive models to reduce the computational complexity of the forecasting task, while still preserving predictive accuracy. The experimental results, which benchmark DAFT-E against multivariate (VAR and deep learning) alternatives on two real case studies, show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art and representation learning models according to several forecasting accuracy metrics.","1949-3037","","10.1109/TSTE.2021.3130949","Service Public de Wallonie Recherche(grant numbers:2010235–ARIAC); DIGITALWALLONIA4.AI; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627632","Ensemble forecasting;forecasting model validation;machine learning;power system operations;spatio temporal features;wind power forecasting","Forecasting;Predictive models;Wind power generation;Feature extraction;Data models;Reactive power;Computational modeling;Global warming","","16","","41","IEEE","26 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The safety of using lithium-ion battery is, therefore, always a topic of concern. Researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently found that a personal dust monitor (PDM) powered by a lithium-ion battery could unintentionally produce RF radiation that electromagnetically interfered with the miner-wearable-component (MWC) of a magnetic proximity detection system (PDS) causing the MWC to function improperly. A PDM is worn by a miner to continuously monitor dust exposure. A PDS consists of its magnetic radiation antennas mounted on a mining machine to generate steady magnetic fields and an MWC that measures magnetic fields to determine if the miner is at a safe distance from the machine. If the miner is at an unsafe distance, the PDS will warn the miner or stop the machine to protect the miner from being pinned or struck. Electromagnetic interference from a PDM causes the PDS to fail to warn the miner and to stop the machine putting the miner at risk. In an effort to understand the nature of this interference, NIOSH researchers characterized RF emissions from the PDM and found that the lithium-ion battery pack was the strongest RF emission source among the internal components. NIOSH researchers also investigated different shielding materials as a mitigation strategy to reduce RF emissions and to prevent accidents potentially caused by interference with the PDS. The measurements of RF radiation from a PDM's lithium-ion battery and the results of the shielding material evaluation are presented in this paper.","1559-9450","978-1-7281-3403-1","10.1109/PIERS-Spring46901.2019.9017575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9017575","","Lithium-ion batteries;Battery charge measurement;Antenna measurements;Radio frequency;Magnetic noise;Magnetic shielding","","3","","8","USGov","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, the applied methods shall cope with modelling uncertainty due to data uncertainty of not yet commissioned components, data tolerances of the existing components and not explicitly defined data of the distributed harmonic emission sources. The harmonic assessment has concluded noticeable harmonic amplification within the reconstructed 150 kV UGC grid and proposed a passive harmonic filter as the mitigation solution.
