The success of GEO-FL largely hinges on mitigating signal degradation caused by atmospheric turbulence. Adaptive optics (AO)-based pre-compensation has emerged as a game-changing approach, offering the potential to ensure consistent link budgets. However, this endeavor presents several challenges, including the need for precise calibration, turbulence mitigation through AO, addressing anisoplanatism, and integrating high-power sources compatible with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) and very high data rate modulation within a shared optical path. ONERA is at the forefront of tackling these challenges with its research-oriented optical ground station, FEELINGS (FEEder LINks optical Ground Station). FEELINGS aims to pioneer innovative concepts, components, algorithms, and thus to pave the way for future operational, high capacity and high efficiency OGS systems. Here, we provide insights into in-laboratory results and performance assessments, shedding light on the system’s development challenges and initial high-power laser performance tests, marking a significant milestone in the project’s progress. Additionally, the paper offers glimpses of the on-site implementation.","","979-8-3503-0790-0","10.1109/ICSOS59710.2023.10490280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10490280","Optical ground station;adaptive optics;optical feeder link","Integrated optics;Satellites;Optical design;Wavelength division multiplexing;Optical fiber communication;Adaptive optics;Optical modulation","","1","","6","IEEE","9 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This makes it vital to perform a ROADM-aware optimization of the network performance at the physical layer. In particular, the use of different modulation options is known to have a strong impact on the extent of the filtering-induced penalties. In that regard, a long debate between single- and multi-carrier modulation has been taking place during the last few years, sometimes leading to apparently contradictory results. Following the open scientific discussion on this topic, in this work, we investigate by simulation and experimentally the wavelength selective switch (WSS) filtering tolerance of single-carrier (SC) and digital subcarrier multiplexing (DSCM) signals. In order to promote a fair comparison, both modulation options are carefully designed to minimize the ROADM-filtering penalties, namely resorting to the use of entropy loading together with baud rate optimization. After some preliminary numerical assessment, a comprehensive set of experiments are carried out for the transmission of 21-WDM 95–105 Gbaud SC and DSCM signals over a 2040 km straight line of fiber with regularly spaced WSSs. In general, our results allow to conclude that the two modulation options yield similar performance if the overall baud rate is optimized for each filtering scenario, keeping the baud rate at $\pm$5% of the optimized value.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2023.3259684","MSCA RISE programme through Project DIOR(grant numbers:10100828); Ph.D. Fellowship from FCT Grants(grant numbers:2021.06736.BD,UI/BD/151328/2021); Fellowship from la Caixa Foundation(grant numbers:100010434,LCF/BQ/PR20/11770015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10077549","Multi-carrier;WSS filtering;probabilistic con- stellation shaping;variable roll-off;optical fiber communication","Bandwidth;Filtering;Loading;Clocks;Symbols;Optical switches;Optical fiber filters","","2","","22","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two-frequency RF operation is found to be effective in reducing multipactor strength compared with single-frequency RF operation with the same total RF power. Strong multipactor mitigation is also demonstrated for nonsinusoidal RF fields of multiple frequencies. Migration of multipactor trajectory is shown for different configurations of the two-frequency RF field.

However, the prerequisite of smoothening of peaks and imbalances through bidirectional charging is concatenated with the undesired impacts on reliability and security of power system operation when there are probable intrusions in the eXtreme Fast Charging (XFC) station, hence destabilizing the charging networks. So this paper applies STRIDE based threat modeling to analyze and identify multiple potential threats endured by the cyber-physical system (CPS) of XFC station by using weighted attack defense tree. Potential mitigation strategies are then suggested for the identified severe threats. In addition, this paper also develops a stochastic probabilistic tool, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for modeling the security attacks for a given range of identified attack vectors and hence employing an appropriate defense strategy against the malicious hacker. Also, a weighted attack defense tree has been developed to generate various attack scenarios. In the end, the results of the proposed work are substantiated and validated if it is able to considerably improve overall charging efficiency and cyber-physical security of the charging station network.","1944-9933","978-1-6654-0823-3","10.1109/PESGM48719.2022.9917219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9917219","","Hidden Markov models;Stochastic processes;Reliability;Probabilistic logic;Power system reliability;Petroleum;Electric vehicle charging","","1","","","IEEE","27 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, a more disruptive approach, the nonlinear Fourier transform, aims at designing signaling schemes more suited to the nonlinear fiber channel. In a short period, impressive results have been reported by modulating either the continuous spectrum or the discrete spectrum. Additionally, very recent works further introduced the opportunity to modulate both spectra for single polarization transmission. Here, we extend the joint modulation scheme to dual-polarization transmission by introducing the framework to construct a dual-polarization optical signal with the desired continuous and discrete spectra. After a brief analysis of the numerical algorithms used to implement the proposed scheme, the first experimental demonstration of dual-polarization joint nonlinear frequency division multiplexing modulation is reported for up to 3200 km of low-loss transmission fiber.

This situation is fostering a growing interest in shifting global energy production toward renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. Hydropower plays an important role in meeting global carbon mitigation targets and eventually achieving net-zero carbon emissions, especially within the Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) energy market in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), where hydropower currently comprises 50-65% of its generation. However, other renewable energy sources in the Mid-C market and connected California Independent System Operator (CAISO) power grid are expanding significantly, particularly solar power in California (CA). Thus, hydropower operations at plants within the connected Mid-C market may need to be re-operated to balance the more intermittent supply from renewables in CA so that energy supplies are in phase with demands. In this study, our goal is to re-design hydropower operations in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) of the PNW to achieve a 95% renewable energy power grid in CA and the PNW by the year 2035. This will require not only filling supply gaps from other renewable energy sources, but also balancing other conflicting objectives to be fulfilled by the dam operations, such as minimizing environmental spill violations, maximizing hydropower production, maximizing flood protection, and maximizing economic benefits. We use multi-objective optimization to design alternative operations at four CRB dams to balance these objectives over the historical record. We then simulate their operations over alternative possible future climate change and energy development scenarios to find a recommended set of operations that are robust to these uncertainties. The energy scenarios include the National Renewable Energy Lab’s (NREL) Mid-Case Energy Scenario for the years 2025, 2030 and 2035, which achieve 95% Renewables by 2035, as well as a business as usual (BAU), or base case, scenario represented by the historical energy mix. The four climate scenarios are made from combinations of low or high warming and low or high streamflow for three overlapping time steps: 2020-2029, 2025-2034, and 2030-2039. Our optimization is able to find a robust compromise policy that balances the system’s conflicting objectives well both now and in the future. We close by exploring how this policy coordinates operations across system reservoirs, which could inform reservoir operators in the CRB about how to adapt operations as the system changes in the future.","","979-8-3503-0064-2","10.1109/SIEDS58326.2023.10137810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10137810","","Renewable energy sources;Uncertainty;Dams;Hydroelectric power generation;Production;Reservoirs;Power grids;Climate change","","","","18","IEEE","31 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, results of aerial clutter mitigation obtained by applying adaptive clutter suppression (ACS) to a 1.3-GHz WPR are shown. The 1.3-GHz WPR used in this study has 13 antenna subarrays that compose the main antenna (MSAs). Five-element Yagi–Uda antennas were also used as antenna subarrays for detecting clutters from low elevation angles (CSAs). The CSAs were used only in reception and installed so that they covered most of the horizontal directions and the horizontal and vertical polarizations. The directionally constrained minimization of power (DCMP) method was used as the adaptive signal processing to mitigate clutter. By the DCMP method, the weighted sum of the signals collected by 13 MSAs and 11 CSAs was computed so that the power of output signals was minimized under the constraint of constant gain in the antenna beam direction. Results of a case study for an aerial clutter from a low elevation angle at 17:04:37 on October 1, 2020, showed that an overlap of the aerial clutter over a desired echo (i.e., clear-air echo) was solved by decreasing the aerial clutter whose peak intensity was ~24 dB greater than that of the clear-air echo.

The share of UGC in the Danish transmission grid is increasing. Presence of UGC has resulted in that resonances of the harmonic impedance characteristics of the transmission grid are brought within the harmonic order range coinciding with the harmonic distortion and causing systemwide increase of the harmonic voltage distortion in the 400 kV meshed transmission grid. Transformation of the 400 kV transmission grid arises needs of predicting the harmonic voltage distortion using simulation models to secure an adequate power quality and support investment decisions and harmonic mitigation for the grid stage which is not yet established and differs from the present grid. This paper presents a method of direct simulation of the harmonic voltage distortion, which is developed and applied by Energinet, Transmission System Operator of Denmark, using Eastern Danish 400 kV transmission grid as a case study. The main advantage of direct simulation is possibility to predict whether, where in the transmission grid, and for which harmonic orders, the not yet commissioned connections may cause violation of the IEC planning levels and which mitigation is necessary for bringing the harmonic distortion down below the planning levels with a given margin.

However, the benefits can only be realized if the self-interference (SI) is sufficiently suppressed. RF cancellation is important for IBFD systems due to its ability of SI mitigation. But it becomes more difficult for RF cancellation while the frequency and bandwidth increase. In real scenarios, the response of the multi-path SI channel is not frequency-flat, which also limits the cancellation performance. To solve these problems, we present a photonic-enabled multi-tap RF canceller in this paper. The proposed RF canceller has the ability of cancelling multi-path SI. The tap coefficients are precisely adjusted by optical spectrum processing. A prototype system with 8 taps is demonstrated in this paper. The measured results show 25 dB average cancellation depth over 1 GHz cancellation bandwidth under over-the-air conditions. To verify the signal of interest (SOI) recovery capability of the novel RF canceller, an IBFD wireless communication experiment based on 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) was demonstrated, the SOI was successfully recovered.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2022.3207787","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2203301); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9895328","Self-interference;RF cancellation;microwave photonics;in-band full-duplex","Radio frequency;Optical receivers;Optical filters;Optical modulation;Optical sensors;Fiber optics;Stimulated emission","","1","","33","CCBY","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As noise pollution adversely affects the operation and expansion of airports by restricting land zoning and flight patterns, developing precise noise generation and propagation models is imperative. Efforts to minimize the impact of aircraft noise are influenced by the accurate mapping of the geometric distribution of that noise. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) utilizes the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) to model aircraft noise, emissions, and air quality consequences for regulatory compliance and system planning. Aircraft operations and fleet mix data are required when users execute AEDT to compute the noise exposure level. However, such data are difficult to obtain from non-towered airports that lack full-time air traffic facilities and personnel. Several airport operations estimation approaches developed by researchers have shown limitations in accuracy and cost-efficiency of deployment when tested, limiting their usefulness with regards to noise modeling. Meanwhile, tracking aircraft through onboard transponder data was validated as a cost-effective approach to estimate aircraft operations at non-towered airports.The authors designed a platform consisting of three modules. Flight operations and aircraft performance parameters can be estimated in the first module by deploying inexpensive hardware to collect aircraft transponder signals. The second module estimates aircraft noise levels by integrating information sources with the noise vs. power vs. distance (NPD) data from the EUROCONTROL Aircraft Noise and Performance (ANP) database. The third module visualizes airport noise impact based on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Additionally, a risk assessment and a sustainability analysis are presented in this paper.","","978-1-6654-1250-6","10.1109/SIEDS52267.2021.9483734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9483734","aviation;noise assessment;ADS-B","Databases;Atmospheric modeling;FAA;Tools;Airports;Air traffic control;Transponders","","3","","35","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Precision agricultural (PA) practices necessitate the availability of field-scale, high-resolution remote sensing data products. This study focuses on the design and development of a cost-effective, portable L-band microwave radiometer capable of operating from an unmanned aircraft system platform to measure high-resolution surface brightness temperature ($T_{B}$). This radiometer consists of a dual-polarized (Horizontal polarized, H-pol and Vertical polarized, V-pol) antenna and a software-defined radio-based receiver system with a 30 MHz sampling rate. The post-processing methodology encompasses the conversion of raw in-phase and quadratic (I&Q) surface emissions to radiation $T_{B}$ through internal and external calibrations. Radiometric measurements were conducted over an experimental site covering both bare soil within an agricultural field and a large water body. The results yielded a high-resolution $T_{B}$ map that effectively delineated the boundaries between land and water, and identified land surface features. The radiometric temperature measurements of the sky and blackbody demonstrated a standard deviation of 0.95 K for H-pol and 0.57 K for V-pol in the case of the sky and 0.39 K for both H-pol and V-pol in the case of the blackbody observations. The utilization of I&Q samples acquired via the radiometer digital back-end facilitates the generation of different time–frequency (TF) analyses through short-time Fourier transform and power spectral density (PSD). The transformation of radiometer samples into TF representations aids in the identification and mitigation of radio frequency interference originating from the instrument itself and external sources.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3394054","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2030291); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10508892","Brightness temperature;L-band;microwave;precision agriculture (PA);radiometer;soil moisture (SM);unmanned aircraft system (UAS)","Microwave radiometry;L-band;Microwave measurement;Radio frequency;Ocean temperature;Microwave theory and techniques;Sea surface","","","","55","CCBY","26 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Wave Tug is an innovation in propulsion technology evolved from decades of research and testing in ocean powered systems, and delivers commercially useful towing forces through harnessing the energy dense orbital motion of open ocean wave streams. The Wave Tug requires zero-fuel inputs, has zero carbon emissions and delivers towing forces comparable with existing ocean-going tugs. The development of the Wave Tug technology is here discussed with its first application in the collection of ocean plastics, and in combination with a proposed ocean waste concentration technology. The problem of ocean plastic waste is well understood, and the need to remove in the near-term the plastics currently in the oceans to avoid further food-chain and environmental contamination is critical. The key requirements of a realistic technology to remove plastics from the open ocean are identified as; (1) The ability to reliably track specified navigation routes identified through live weather and shipping data and the identification of high densities of plastics; (2) To continuously sweep large areas of ocean with minimal intervention and no crew requirements; (3) To securely store collected waste; (4) To concentrate the waste collected; (5) Minimise negative impacts on marine ecology. An array of ten harvesting devices is calculated to be capable of sweeping the area of the North Pacific Garbage Patch in less than ten years, and to provide an economically and technical viable solution to the existing environmental crisis. The paper discusses the development timeline of the Wave Tug and Waste Concentration technology, and the key steps in achieving open ocean deployment of an effective and reliable plastic harvesting device.

In recent years, many electric aircraft prototypes for short-haul commuting air transport have been designed. Most of them are supposed to be deployed in the real airports by 2030 - 2035. However, the ground power systems and associated electric aircraft charging operation are also essential for realising electrified aviation. Moreover, various renewable generation technologies in terms of PVs and micro wind turbines, electric vehicles and energy storage systems are expected to be integrated into the airport to form a decarbonised microgrid energy system. Therefore, there is a challenge of designing airport microgrids associated with energy scheduling algorithms for electric aircraft charging as well as airport decarbonisation. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-agent real-time microgrid energy scheduling solution for electrified air transport. The coordination algorithm between the electric aircraft charging system and the electric vehicles charging in the airport parking lot is developed to enhance the resilience and operational flexibility of the airport microgrid. The stochastic behaviours of the airport passengers and renewable power generation are integrated into the airport microgrid energy management solution. The study shows that the airport microgrid can achieve the resilience through the proposed energy management solution.","","978-1-83953-606-9","10.1049/icp.2021.2351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9654105","","","","2","","","","17 Dec 2021","","","IET","IET Conferences"

To this end, a real-time energy management strategy is proposed via incorporating double-delay Q-Learning and model predictive control (MPC). First, the energy management for PHEV is transformed into a nonlinear optimal control problem, and the vehicle speed predictor based on convolutional neural network is proposed to forecast vehicle speed in MPC. Then, based on the predicted vehicle speed, the double-delay Q-Learning algorithm is implemented to solve the receding horizon optimal problem in the MPC module. The simulation is conducted to verify the performance of the proposed strategy, and the results showcase that incorporating the double-delay Q-Learning into MPC can effectively improve the adaptability of energy management to dynamic environment, and meanwhile achieve a similar fuel consumption of the offline stochastic dynamic programming-based strategy.

Addressing these challenges, we propose a novel and lightweight approach, namely RaFID, to detect and locate the RFI by incorporating deep neural networks (DNNs) and statistical analysis via batch-wise mean aggregation and standard deviation (SD) calculations. RaFID investigates the generation of an expected signal using DNNs within the time domain.

As the GSO arc encompasses the primary and existing satellite assets providing essential fixed and broadcasting satellite services, the interference avoidance for this area is of the utmost importance. In particular, non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) operators should comply with the regulations set up both by their national regulators and by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to minimize the impact of emissions on existing GSO and non-GSO systems. In this paper, we first provide an overview of the most recent radio regulations that dictate the NGSO-GSO spectral co-existence. Next, we analyze the NGSO-GSO radio frequency interference for the downlink scenario, following the so-called time-simulation methodology introduced by ITU.
