The importance of electrical power generation and consumption pair has been increasing due to extensive use of fly-by-wire in modern aircraft. In order to maintain the safe and successful flight operations, we must ensure the electrical power generation and consumption pair meets the electromagnetic interference requirements set by regulatory agencies and industrial standards. We would like to demonstrate this electromagnetic effect design and analysis processes with modern aviation power system examples. For electromagnetic effects, we consider the radio frequency emissions and lightning effects which originate in power generation subsystems. Those electromagnetic effects affect the downstream electrical power consumption subsystems. We want to analyze the electromagnetic interference at the power generation subsystem and at the power consumption subsystem. From design and certification point of view, we need to assess the typical maximum strengths of the transient level of the emission and lightning, and analyze the downstream effects at the location of the affected power consumption subsystems. This process enables design, qualification and certification of the electrical power generation and consumption pair. We describe the power generation and consumption pair fundamentals. The details of evaluating the broadband emission noise are presented. We discuss the optimum solutions that help resolve these RF and lightning issues.

As energy end-users/consumers are the underlying driver of emissions, it would be difficult to effectively mitigate carbon emissions by creating an emission trading market without active end-users’ involvement. In electricity markets, demand side management (DSM) in the smart grid can manage demands in response to power supply conditions and influence end-users to contribute to improving both network efficiency and economic efficiency. However, it is a relatively new topic to study the environmental benefits of DSM. This paper proposes a two-stage scheduling model to comprehensively investigate the environmental benefits of consumers participating in both electricity and carbon emission trading markets through active DSM. A developed zero sum gains-data envelopment analysis (ZSG-DEA) model based multi-criteria allocation scheme for emission allocation is employed. Meanwhile, the carbon emission flow model (CEF) is applied to track the “virtual” carbon flow accompanying power flow. According to case studies on the IEEE 24-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system, the proposed model can effectively achieve carbon emission mitigation and provide consumers extra environmental benefits in some scenarios.

To this end, we compare the modeled cost-optimal operation with CO2-minimizing dispatch plans where different limits for the additional, specific CO2 mitigation costs are set. At first, the operational mitigation potential of today's combined heat and power (CHP) driven energy system is analyzed. Then we examine the possible effects of increased flexibility of this multi-energy system by adding heat pumps and heat storage. We include a detailed account of today's operational cost structure including taxes and subsidies. To correctly represent the CO2 footprint of consumed electricity from the grid, we consider the CO2 intensity of Germany's electricity mix as time-dependent. This is important to correctly honor the impact of the multi-energy system's flexibility. We find that given the current regulatory environment, without considering investment costs, large CO2 reductions compared to the modeled cost-optimal operation can only be achieved for specific CO2 mitigation costs above 150€/t. Small reductions can be obtained at much lower cost when a heat pump operates in parallel with the CHP. However, for all scenarios the CO2 reductions can only be realized by exploiting periods with low CO2 intensity of the grid's electricity.","","978-1-6654-4875-8","10.1109/ISGTEurope52324.2021.9640071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9640071","CO2 price;CO2 emission;electricity market regulation;energy system optimization","Renewable energy sources;Electric potential;Costs;Heat pumps;Cogeneration;Finance;Europe","","","","8","IEEE","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional methods of reducing emissions from the power system focus on the power generation side. However, recent research underscores that not only the supply side but also the demand side should be accountable for reducing emissions, given that demand fundamentally drives carbon emissions. This paper proposes a two-stage integrated framework for system decarbonization, emphasizing combined emission mitigation from both demand and supply sides. For the generation side, retrofitting coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology can effectively reduce system emissions. The captured gas can also be converted into natural gas using power-to-gas (P2G) equipment, further improving the utilization of CCUS. On the demand side, a modified carbon emission flow model based on CCUS is proposed to capture the impact of the demand side on carbon reduction. Large industrial loads can effectively reduce system emissions without affecting their production progress through real-time carbon response. The proposed method has been validated on the IEEE 24-bus electricity system, confirming the effectiveness of model.","","978-1-6654-7164-0","10.1109/ETFG55873.2023.10408546","Australian Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10408546","Decarbonization;carbon capture;utilization;and storage;coal-fired power plants;carbon response","Supply and demand;Collaboration;Carbon dioxide;Low-carbon economy;Power systems;Power generation;Load modeling","","","","20","IEEE","2 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)installed between the power converters of the tidal and river power system in order to mitigate flickers in different grid conditions. The BESS smooths the active power fluctuations and reduces flicker even from the weak grid with the low impedance angle in the distribution network.

Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is indispensable in these systems and, Pertub and Observe (P&O) algorithm is widely used for MPPT due to its simplicity. The increased penetration of P&O based solar PV systems in the grid has invited notice to the degrading power quality due to the emission of interharmonics, which causes flicker, controller instability, increased losses and resonance. Investigation unveils that the MPPT parameters, step size and sampling frequency, that are pre-set in the P &O algorithm, are the root causes of these emissions. Conventional filtering techniques are not effective in its elimination due to the varying frequency range used in these systems. This paper proposes a novel solution for mitigating interharmonics in PV systems with P&O MPPT algorithm, by controlling the MPPT parameters with a fuzzy based controller, considering the real-time irradiance value and frequency components in PV output. The results substantiate that the power quality has significantly improved with the proposed controller in solar PV system.","","978-1-7281-5672-9","10.1109/PEDES49360.2020.9379819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9379819","Solar PV system;maximum power point tracking;pertub and observe algorithm;interharmonics;fuzzy logic","Maximum power point trackers;Power quality;Resonant frequency;Solar energy;Real-time systems;Power electronics;Standards","","3","","12","IEEE","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous studies and field measurements have confirmed the evidence of interharmonic emission from PV inverters, where the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is one of the main causes for interharmonics. In that regard, the MPPT parameters such as their sampling rate has a strong impact on the interharmonic characteristic of the PV system. In general, there is a trade-off between the interharmonic emission and the MPPT performance when selecting the sampling rate of the MPPT algorithm. More specifically, employing a faster MPPT sampling rate will improve the MPPT efficiency, but it will also increase the interharmonic emission level. To solve this issue, a new mitigating solution for interharmonics in PV systems is proposed in this paper. The proposed method modifies the MPPT algorithm in a way to randomly select the sampling rate between the fast and the slow value. By doing so, the interharmonics in the output current can be effectively reduced due to the distribution of the frequency spectrum. On the other hand, the MPPT performance of the proposed method can be maintained similar to the case when employing a fast MPPT sampling rate. The effectiveness of the proposed interharmonic mitigation has been validated experimentally on a single-phase grid-connected PV system.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2019.2902880","Reliable Power Electronic-Based Power System (REPEPS); Department of Energy Technology; Aalborg Universitet; Villum Investigator Program; Villum Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658164","Interharmonics;inverters;maximum power point tracking (MPPT);photovoltaic (PV) systems;power quality","Maximum power point trackers;Inverters;Phase locked loops;Perturbation methods;Oscillators;Frequency modulation;Voltage control","","104","","13","IEEE","3 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the lack of pervasive en-route charging infrastructure on regional highway networks hinders the use of electric vehicles for long-distance intercity trips. Traditionally, transportation and power systems are often studied separately, each by itself as a complex system. This paper proposes a system of systems modeling framework for planning charging infrastructure deployment in intercity transportation networks while considering users’ travel behavior and coupling relationships between transportation and power systems. The aim is at facilitating long-distance electric vehicle travels and providing an effective and comprehensive tool to evaluate the total emissions from both the transportation and power sectors. We look at a somewhat “forward-looking” problem in which the charging loads of widely-adopted electric vehicles induce interdependence between the power and the transportation sectors. A general equilibrium modeling framework is developed to capture the interdependencies among charging infrastructure design, users’ travel behaviors, and power sector operations. An iterative solution approach is proposed to solve the overall equilibrium between the transportation and power sectors, and a heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the bi-level subproblem for the charging infrastructure deployment. Numerical experiments based on a semi-realistic case study are performed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed modeling and solution approach.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3076008","Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment (iSEE) at the University of Illinois; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI-1662825); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72001136); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9430758","Electric vehicle;charging infrastructure;emission mitigation;electricity pricing","Transportation;Planning;Power systems;Electric vehicle charging;Mathematical model;Charging stations;Batteries","","11","","30","CCBY","13 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
