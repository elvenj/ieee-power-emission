Grid to Vehicle (G2V) and Vehicle to Grid (V2G) will be the main challenge of the future smart networks with the increasing population of electric vehicles (EVs). Apart from all the advantages of massive use of electric vehicles, this can cause some problems in the electricity network system, such as the reliability and power quality of the distribution network system. For instance, when the battery charging takes place, the transformer may become overloaded, and another problem such as faster aging of a transformer may occur. Utilization of PV in charging station (SPKLU) or parking lot (PVP) of electric vehicles may become a solution. Another possible solution is to separate the general load or customers from the electric vehicle loads through additional utility transformers, so that the reliability and power quality of general customers will not be impacted by the electric car battery charging activity. In this research, the combined effects of EVs and PVP on the loading and aging of utility transformers are examined based on IEEE Std C57.91-1995. EVs load profile is modeled with monte carlo simulations and tested on a distribution system with 4 different scenarios. It was obtained that the use of PVP and the separation of EVs and general loads may improve the reliability and quality of the distribution network system and maintain transformer lifetime.","","978-1-7281-8835-5","10.1109/ICT-PEP50916.2020.9249941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9249941","EVs;Monte-Carlo;reliability and power quality of distribution system;PV;parking lot;transformer","Monte Carlo methods;Power quality;Distribution networks;Aging;Power system reliability;Reliability;Load modeling","","4","","16","IEEE","10 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) is a crucial component in Distribution Management Systems. However, despite Transmission System State Estimation being common since its inception in the late 1960s, its methods are not directly transferable to DSSE since transmission systems differ from distribution networks in their operation, design, and topology.

However, the continuous increase in switching frequencies resulting from these power electronics technologies has led to the emergence of new emissions in the range of 2-150 kHz, outside the classical frequency range for power quality. These emissions are known worldwide as supraharmonics (SH). These emissions negatively affect the power quality of electrical distribution systems and reduce their efficiency and lifetime. Thus, the supraharmonics emissions have been investigated in the literature, and several methods were developed focusing on identifying, measuring, and setting new standards to mitigate the impact of these emissions on the power quality. Although these individual studies have been well documented, a comparative overview of its identifications, current standards, and measurement techniques had not been described so far. Therefore, this study extensively reviews the related techniques and standards for identifying, measuring, and mitigating SH emissions. Moreover, the current research gap in this important field is highlighted, and an illustration on how this problem was tackled in the past few years is presented. Additionally, the SH characteristics alongside insights into the mitigations and measurements are highlighted and analyzed accordingly.

Consequently, an effective fault diagnosis strategy is critical to effectively utilize the grid’s equipment and minimize the impact of faults on the system and its components. Quick detection and localization of faults lead to faster isolation and restoration of supply thereby improving power quality and network reliability. This paper presents a sparse matrix reconstruction technique to detect faults with the help of PMU. In this paper, optimal placement of PMUs is done first, and then positive seq voltage of both pre-fault and during-fault conditions are measured. The difference between them is then used to recover the current change vector through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with the help of which fault is detected.

The significance of maximum electric field stress at triple points (TPs) is examined. Furthermore, the paper reviews the strategies and techniques employed to mitigate the challenges related to maximum field stress and PDs in both encapsulation and substrate materials. It is concluded that the mitigation strategies are promising in improving insulation systems for packaging, but the studies lack their implementation under actual operating conditions of WBG power modules.","","979-8-3503-3120-2","10.1109/TPEC60005.2024.10472278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10472278","WBG power module packaging;high voltage;insulation;high power density;partial discharge;electric field reduction;triple points;partial discharge inception voltage;high temperature","Encapsulation;Silicon carbide;Reviews;Multichip modules;Voltage;Power electronics;Gallium nitride","","1","","45","IEEE","22 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

India through its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has shown its commitment on mitigating Green House Gases. In February 2015, India stated its federal mission is to achieve 175 GW of Renewable Energy based capacity by the year 2022. This paper analyses the solar capacity installed through solar parks in India, corresponding power produced with prevailing solar insolations and potential Greenhouse gas abated. The current identified 20 GW solar park project with varying solar insolation of 4 - 5 kWh/m2/day has potential to produce 37155982 MWh of solar power and mitigate 34672792 tonnes of CO2/annually. Similarly, additional 40 GW Solar park capacity being considered would generate 74311963 MWh mitigating 69345584 tonnes of CO2 annually. Better solar suitability areas would help in enhanced solar generation by 15% more as compared to moderate and low solar areas. Capacity planned through Solar Parks would help in mitigating 1.40% and 2.81% of Greenhouse gases of the total India's emissions respectively.","","978-1-7281-8334-3","10.1109/ICUE49301.2020.9307039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307039","Emission factor;Giga Watt;Green house gases;Renewable energy;Solar parks","Renewable energy sources;Green products;Air pollution;Mathematical model;Greenhouse effect;Wind power generation;Solar power generation;Climate change","","4","","22","IEEE","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence, there is a significant supply constraint which is predicted to continue until at least 2025, a crisis which precipitated the introduction of the Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (RMI4P). The bid outcomes of the RMI4P have highlighted an intrinsic weakness with the concept of independent, distributed electricity generation. Isolated units which are unable to balance supply/demand profiles across the whole system will by necessity incur higher cost. In this article, it is shown that a system wide programme which allowed for energy wheeling between operators with complementary supply profiles, would have been a 25% lower cost option for energy consumers, and reduced carbon emissions from 349 kg carbon dioxide/MWh to zero.","","978-1-6654-4231-2","10.1109/ICECET52533.2021.9698448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698448","emergency power;South Africa;renewable energy","Procurement;Costs;Carbon dioxide;Coal;Delays;Risk management","","","","18","IEEE","11 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of MHS microgrid is motivated by the fact that MHS is a remote area in Thailand where it has been facing with power system's service interruption several times a year, due to natural disasters. Nonetheless, there are renewable energy resources such as mini-hydro and solar power plants inside the area that can sufficiently supply the local electricity demand most of the times throughout a year. Here, Community Energy Management System (CEMS) which minimizes the combined total economic and emission costs during grid-connected mode, while distinctly ensures smooth transition to a reliable microgrid during islanding mode, by properly utilizing battery energy storage system (BESS) and water reserve, has been developed. The proposed formulation of the day-ahead schedulings of mini-hydro generation and BESS is solved using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The simulated test results for one week, both during dry and rainy seasons, confirm that CEMS can significantly improve reliability of MHS microgrid with the designed feature of smooth transition to islanding mode.","","978-1-7281-3076-7","10.1109/iEECON48109.2020.229486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9077423","Community Energy Management System;Microgrid;Battery Energy Storage System;Mini-hydro power;disaster mitigation","","","1","","8","IEEE","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The usual approach is to send excess energy to the main grid, with a cost of unpredictability of the reverse power flow. In order to achieve a high penetration of renewables in the distribution grid, with added contribution from prosumers, traditional grids need to be operated in states corresponding to active grids for which they have not been designed. Recently deployed solutions allow advanced prosumers to benefit from advancements in both storage and renewables technologies, changing the behavior of prosumers into controlled unidirectional power exchange (no-back generation), which translates into consumer-only behavior from the grid side. With this no-back generation paradigm, in this paper a number of comprehensive scenarios have been simulated and analyzed on a daily basis, based on real local production and consumption profiles and using key performance indexes. The paper shows the benefits of operating and customers with prosumers potential, which can bring substantial openings for a high renewables penetration agenda to address climate change related issues.","","978-1-7281-0750-9","10.1109/MPS.2019.8759678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8759678","prosumer;active distribution grid;RES;storage;Key Performance Indicator;energy meter;PCC","Production;Power measurement;Batteries;Time measurement;Microsoft Windows;Climate change;Power markets","","1","","10","IEEE","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the power ramp rate of the grid is limited due to the higher mechanical time constant of the alternators. Higher power ramp rates lead to grid side instability and may deprive the load of getting continuous power. Moreover, from a microgrid perspective, due to the power generation profile of solar-based RES, the power demand from the grid is highly reduced during daytime peaks and increased with high ramp rates during the evening peaks leading to the formation of a duck curve, which economically affects the power generation companies. To reduce the effect of intermittency of the RES on the grid, to flatten the duck curve and reduce the peak demand from the grid during increased load demands, this paper presents an advanced ramp rate-limit (ARRL) control with battery energy storage (BES) for a grid-tied rooftop solar photovoltaic array (SPVA) based microgrid. The control utilizes the power leveling feature of the BES to ensure continuity of power supply to the loads during RES intermittency or high load demand conditions. This paper also presents a modified adaptive third-order interweaved generalized integrator (MATOIGI) based control to enhance the power quality of the microgrid during distortions/unbalance in grid voltages or load currents and to ensure that the MG performance is not deteriorated as per the IEEE std. 1547.","","978-1-6654-9365-9","10.1109/GlobConPT57482.2022.9938346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9938346","Solar Photovoltaic Array;Power Leveling;Battery;Peak Demand;Evening Peaks;Duck Curve Mitigation;Microgrid;Ramp Rate Limit;MATOIGI-FLL;Power Quality","Photovoltaic systems;Economics;Renewable energy sources;Power demand;Power quality;Microgrids;IEEE Standards","","","","19","IEEE","14 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regardless of the generator's rotational speed, the DC link voltage between RSC and GSC must be maintained constant. During sub-synchronous operation, the GSC receives power from the stator terminals, converts it to DC, and delivers it to the rotor as a slip power through the RSC. This paper focuses on two main objectives. Firstly, solar energy is used to keep the DC link voltage constant. This makes the system hybrid renewable energy system. The solar panels along with MPPT technique gives maximum power output from the panels which is used to excite the rotor of DFIG. Secondly, The MPPT for PV arrays and controller at Rotor Side Converter for DFIG will be controlled by a combined fuzzy logic controller.
