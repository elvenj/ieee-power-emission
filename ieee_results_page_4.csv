This is the first reported work to apply nonlinear compression based on μ-law companding for UACO-OFDM LiFi systems to reduce PAPR. In order to avoid the effect of the nonlinearity of LED, the transmitted signals are compressed further linearly. The signal distortion caused by nonlinear and linear compression is compensated for using multiple LEDs for simultaneous transmission. The proposed joint PAPR reduction and LED nonlinearity mitigation approach provides low complexity, searching is not required. Also, it is spectrum- and energy-efficient, requiring no pilot and consuming no extra transmission power. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) and bit error rate (BER), and that it is more robust against the LED nonlinearity than conventional UACO-OFDM LiFi systems and other methods in the literature.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761898","","Light emitting diodes;Peak to average power ratio;Light fidelity;Nonlinear distortion;Optical distortion","","6","","23","IEEE","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional method follows charging of EVs using the utility grid which leads to unbalance and burden on the existing distribution system. Hence, to address the issues and reduce the dependency on fossil fuel which are limitedly available and cause the air pollution, the charging of EV is encouraged with the use of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) such as solar energy, wind energy, tidal energy, and biomass etc. Among all these energy sources, the solar photovoltaic (PV) based system is a best and feasible solution for EV charging. Also, the main barrier in EV adoption is more charging time and hence to rectify the issues many researchers have been in progress in EV solar powered Fast Charging Station (FCS).

This paper presents a system-based approach to study the coupling between electricity and DH sector for effective mitigation of emissions. A mixed integer linear programming framework is proposed that aims to exploit the flexibility of electricity cogeneration together with partial electrification of the DH system by investing in renewable technologies. The objective is to simultaneously minimize the investment cost and emissions. Both the electricity and DH load profiles are segregated into critical and flexible types. Comprehensive demand response (DR) framework of thermostatically controlled loads and electric vehicles is considered while preserving the chronology. The framework is applied to the Finnish energy system considering the generation mix. Results prove that coordinating the electricity cogeneration with renewable generation combined with partly shifting from DH to electrified heating has a great potential in reducing the emissions. For an average weather scenario under DR, the least-cost solution guarantees an annual emission reduction of 12.04% relative to the total emissions of Finland against the total investment of €13.24Bn in wind and solar power generation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3105829","Aalto University as part of the ‘Renewable Finland’ project organized by the ‘Academy of Finland’; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515983","Base-load generation;carbon emissions;district heating;demand response;power to heat;two-capacity building model","Buildings;Space heating;Water heating;Resistance heating;Solar heating;Cogeneration;Load management","","9","","86","CCBY","18 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dataset, sourced from authoritative entities like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), provides a granular view of each country’s historical and current CO2 emissions landscape. In this study, we employed multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, MLP Classifier, KNN, and Decision Tree, to forecast CO2 emissions. Preliminary results indicate that the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models achieved an impeccable accuracy of 100%, showcasing their robust predictive capabilities. In contrast, the MLP Classifier presented challenges in distinguishing certain classes, underscoring the need for further optimization. Beyond mere prediction, the research underscores the potential of these models in real-time mitigation strategies. By understanding the emission patterns and their contributing factors, policymakers and stakeholders can devise more effective, data-driven strategies to reduce the carbon footprint. Moreover, the study serves as a testament to the power of machine learning in addressing some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.

The Malaysian government is promoting energy-efficient vehicles (EEV) including future electric vehicles (EV), and aims to have 100% of EEV on-road by 2030. With the implementation of EV policies in Malaysia, these policies will act as an agitator for the mass adoption of EVs in Malaysian usage. However, from the viewpoint of the power system, EVs are additional loads when connect to the power grid. The massive penetration of charging station (CS) load has negatively impacted the distribution system, especially on the power losses. Hence, this situation has led to the need for unifying rules for the distribution system to accommodate this additional charging demand. In this research, the mitigation proposed is to implement optimal placement and sizing of multiple capacitor banks (CBs) for medium and low voltage distribution network systems optimized using the metaheuristic technique. The distribution system, CS and CBs are modelled using MATLAB environment. The metaheuristic technique used is Lightning Search Algorithm (LSA) and Modified Lightning Search Algorithm (MLSA) due to effectiveness from past research. Based on the simulation result, the MLSA method will best minimize the power losses at the practical 69-bus radial distribution network system. The study has proven that the optimal placement and sizing of variable CBs could reduce power loss. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the multiple of CBs can provide a superior solution compared to a single CB. Hence, it concluded that the multiple CBs with the assistance of the MLSA method are the most suitable to be implemented in reducing power losses in distribution systems due to the massive penetration of EVs load.","","978-1-6654-0129-6","10.1109/CENCON51869.2021.9627265","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)(grant numbers:17J76); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627265","Electric Vehicle;Power Loss;Distribution System;Metaheuristic Technique","Simulation;Metaheuristics;Government;Lightning;Distribution networks;Charging stations;Electric vehicles","","5","","21","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simultaneously transportation electrification is becoming a point of concern for power utilities and Distribution System Operators (DSO). Because of this, a simulation framework to understand the system conditions with extensive EV penetration, from the perspective of DSO, is needed. For this purpose, the modified CIGRE-MV 14-node test distribution network was modeled and simulated using the real-time open-source simulator, Dynamic Phasor Simulator (DPSim). It offers features such as Common Information Model import, realtime capability, and interfaces for communication with other simulators. This makes the simulator an ideal choice for performing real-time power flow simulation studies and controller hardware-in-the-loop simulations. The power flow data is communicated to the Power Management (PM) algorithm for analysis with the help of the lightweight Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. This setup is demonstrated by applying it for analyzing the impacts of increasing penetration levels of EVs in the network that results in critical loading conditions during the peak-load hours. The anticipated impact is addressed by power injections from the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) determined and initiated by the PM algorithm.","","978-1-6654-4875-8","10.1109/ISGTEurope52324.2021.9640005","The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(grant numbers:01MZ18006G); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9640005","Battery Energy Storage System;distribution network;DPsim;Electric Vehicle charging;MQTT","Analytical models;Hardware-in-the-loop simulation;Transportation;Europe;Distribution networks;Real-time systems;Batteries","","3","","19","IEEE","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To operate equipment requiring alternating current (AC), or to connect to a utility’s distribution system, photovoltaic (PV) systems depend upon power electronic converters—devices that chop DC voltage into an approximation of an AC sine wave. Such devices, called inverters, operate at speeds that may produce radio frequency (RF) emissions (also known as electromagnetic interference, or EMI) over a broad range of frequencies. Photovoltaic installations may cover large swathes of territory. How may these emissions be identified, located, and monitored effectively and how may the effectiveness of any mitigation efforts at specific locations be assessed at a future date at the same specific locations? The Autonomous Mobile Measurement Platform (AMMP), a mobile measuring platform first developed to take repeatable measurements of multiple, interior building conditions (light, temperature, air quality, EMI, and others), was adapted for measuring EMI in the outdoor environment, such as at a PV installation. The focus of this paper concerns the application of the AMMP to survey, measure, and record for later analysis EMI conditions at specific points within a PV site— and the repeatable measurement of EMI at those same points in the future.","2150-6655","978-1-7281-7461-7","10.1109/EPQU50182.2020.9220296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9220296","autonomous systems;electromagnetic interference;EMI;inverter noise;mobile robots;photovoltaic cells;radio frequency interference;RFI","Temperature measurement;Photovoltaic systems;Temperature sensors;Radio frequency;Time-frequency analysis;Time measurement;Frequency measurement","","","","0","IEEE","26 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to steep switching waveforms and high switching frequencies, significant electromagnetic disturbances can be emitted. In contrast to conventional passive filter components, active cancellation methods are based on the controlled destructive interference between a noise signal and a corresponding anti-noise signal. Adaptive notch filters revealed themselves as a promising active EMI cancellation concept for periodic noise signals. In this work, adaptive notch filters are regarded in context of slowly time-varying periodic noise signals, e.g. pulse-width modulated signals as common in inverters. The corresponding noise signals consist of switching harmonics and adjacent sideband harmonics. Therefore, the notch filter’s bandwidth comes into focus and an analytical approximation for the ideal adaptive notch filter’s bandwidth is discussed. With help of this approximation, the adaptive notch filter can be parametrized specifically to a given noise spectrum and other requirements. The capability of the parametrization strategy and the adaptive notch filter itself are shown by simulation and measurement.","","978-1-6654-4888-8","10.1109/EMC/SI/PI/EMCEurope52599.2021.9559297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9559297","power electronics;inverter;electromagnetic emissions;adaptive notch filter;active cancellation","Passive filters;Switching frequency;Switching loss;Switches;Bandwidth;Harmonic analysis;Inverters","","8","","18","IEEE","19 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Common practice when undertaking harmonic analysis of REG plants in Australia is to assume that the harmonic emissions of identical equipment, e.g. wind/solar PV inverters, have no significant diversity between sources for all harmonic orders, i.e. the emissions at each harmonic order add arithmetically. The results presented in this paper suggest significant diversity to exist across all harmonic orders within a large wind-based REG plant for significant periods of time. This was determined through analysis of measurements captured within a large wind farm operating in the Australian power system. Such outcomes are important as overly pessimistic assumptions in relation to the aggregation of harmonic sources are capable of increasing the likelihood of mitigation being required. This is also capable of impacting the design process of the mitigation solution.","2164-0610","978-1-6654-1639-9","10.1109/ICHQP53011.2022.9808800","Australian Renewable Energy Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9808800","Harmonic modelling;Harmonic aggregation;Power quality;Compliance assessment","Renewable energy sources;Power measurement;Power cables;Current measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Power system harmonics;Wind farms","","1","","12","IEEE","1 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper reported the presence of human error in UV count measurement. Furthermore, the facular area was applied to be compared with the UV count. The discharge phenomena were generated through various experiments. The results showed that the application of facular area was able to evaluate the insulator condition more accurately if it was compared to the UV count when the data recording was conducted incorrectly.

This has resulted in a need for innovative techniques in electric vehicle smart charging (EVSC) to lower charging costs and optimize renewable energy sources (RES) usage. However, an unsupervised EVSC system may experience overloads or violations of the maximum power defined by the charging point operator (CPO) due to fluctuations in photovoltaic (PV) generation. To address this issue, this study proposes a heuristic method to prevent overloads in the electric vehicle aggregated system (EVAS), considering various 15-minute interval PV generation prediction methods. Specifically, this research compares the effectiveness of different prediction models, such as ARIMA, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM, in minimizing overloads during a 4-week evaluation period. The study’s outcomes are expected to offer valuable insights into creating more efficient and reliable EVSC systems. Both Machine Learning (ML) methods succeeded in reducing the occurrences of overloads by approximately 50%.
