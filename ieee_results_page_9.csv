A key question is what is sector coupling, and how does it impact the flexibility of the energy system? Here, the energy system includes several sectors—electricity, gas, heat, and transportation—that have been independent for decades in most countries except for their coupling via combined heat and power (CHP) units. In energy systems integration, some sectors may provide flexibility to other sectors, while other sectors will require flexibility when interlinking. To support these synergies among sectors, it is important to explore and quantify mutual interactions as well as seek examples of how these integrations can provide flexibility and other benefits. From the perspective of the electricity sector, it is important to ensure that there is enough flexibility in the interconnected systems to support decarbonization goals, such as those set in the Paris Agreement, while ensuring operational reliability.","1558-4216","","10.1109/MPE.2019.2931054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8879609","","Heat pumps;Couplings;Resistance heating;Space heating;Cogeneration;Renewable energy sources;Solar heating;Energy management","","19","","6","IEEE","22 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

For instance, NASA's N3X airplane aims to curb jet fuel emissions with the aid of TeDP. However, it is crucial to analyze the survivability of the TeDP system during extreme conditions. The endogenous failure events are of specific interest as they were found to cause a significant number of accidents for commercial aircraft. While the distribution reconfiguration is necessary to meet the critical load demands under extreme failure events, it can also create a transient overload condition in the turboshaft engine. The power system survivability is further deteriorated in the presence of constant power loads. In this article, a mathematical analysis of the survivability of the system is presented to make the aircraft power system highly resilient to endogenous failure events. A power system collapse mitigation strategy is proposed by adding an energy storage system. Moreover, the analytical expressions are formulated to size the energy storage unit to prevent the system collapse.

These materials, like silicon carbide (SiC), aluminum nitride (AlN), and diamond, offer advantages with higher power density, decreased weight, and expanded operational abilities regarding temperature, voltage, and frequency. However, the pursuit of pushing these limits confronts challenges within insulation systems, which may struggle to endure the demands of these parameters, potentially resulting in unfavorable conditions like high electric field, space charge accumulation, electrical treeing, and partial discharge (PD), leading to insulation failure. The emphasis of this paper is to review the insulation challenges within (U)WBG power modules and recent research in mitigating the electric field stress at triple points (TPs) and resolving the PD issues. The manuscript first discusses the high electric field stress issue at triple points. Then, ceramic substrate materials, encapsulation materials, and the influence of harsh weather conditions on them are reviewed. The space charge, electrical treeing, and PD issues within encapsulation materials are analyzed under practical operation conditions of (U)WBG power modules like high frequency, temperature, and square wave pulses. Finally, the various strategies to alleviate the associated insulation challenges are meticulously discussed. While the identified mitigation strategies are able to strengthen insulation systems for packaging, their validation under actual operational conditions of (U)WBG power modules remains relatively unexplored, representing a potential avenue for further investigation. This review offers a valuable framework by providing the constraints of the current studies and recommendations for the future that can be utilized as a reference point for future research endeavors.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2024.3382070","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2306093); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10479590","(U)WBG power module packaging;partial discharge;triple points;encapsulation material;electric field stress;high power density;field grading materials;nonlinear field-dependent conductivity layer","Substrates;Electric fields;Multichip modules;Ceramics;Stress;Encapsulation;Aluminum nitride","","","","","CCBYNCND","26 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Accordingly, co-channel interference with geostationary orbit (GSO) networks will inevitably affect the operation of NGSO and GSO satellites in the years to come. Towards protecting the well-established GSO systems from the interference produced by the newly launched NGSO satellite constellations, the international telecommunication union (ITU) has established regulations and evaluation metrics for the aggregated emitted power flux-densities from NGSO systems. In conformity with these regulations, the NGSO operators should avoid disruptive emissions, which could lead to acute service interruptions. To reduce the downlink interference levels and alleviate harmful service disconnectivity of satellite constellations, we propose a joint power and tilt control strategy to maximize user demand satisfaction. Our proposed method ensures that the equivalent power flux-density (EPFD) from satellite constellation satisfies the ITU regulatory limits while the radio resource management for the user service is optimized via power control and tilting.

Third, the charging demand prediction error is used to schedule the components in a HESS by considering their inherent properties and operational limits. As a result, the HESS configuration can be determined by analyzing the tradeoff between the investment cost and the monetary penalty due to charging demand forecast error and voltage deviation.

Solar PVs provide an alternative to fossil fuels, with both lower carbon emissions and cost. The falling price of solar energy has made solar PVs increasingly cost effective compared to traditional, non-renewable energy sources. There are, however, a myriad of technological, environmental, political, economic, and social hurdles that prevent wider-spread solar adoption. While several solar-focused government policies and incentives have already been put in place, the government lacks a full understanding of the constraint space preventing widespread solar adoption.

Therefore, the option to use second-life batteries from EVs is a global challenge for protecting the environment and promoting circular economy (CE) development. The industrial sector is increasingly implementing the CE principles in their business models to reach more efficient utilization of resources and sustainable businesses. Recent studies focused on the link between CE and climate change, highlighting the potential positive effects of CE eco-innovations on climate change mitigation. The present study aims to promote the transition to a circular open-loop economy for second-life batteries derived from EVs, evaluating the techno-economic performance and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated to the integration of a battery energy storage system (BESS), made of spent batteries, serving a ball mill machine in a ceramic manufacturing plant. In particular, the average GHGs derived from the Italian electricity mix, in a midweek day, have been considered, assessing hourly emissions. This innovative approach is particularly suited for analyzing renewable energies intermittency. To this purpose, three different scenarios were modeled: Scenario 1, with no BESS; Scenario 2, with a second-life BESS with power grid support; and Scenario 3, with the second-life BESS combined with a standalone PV system. Results showed how the use or non-use of the BESS involves similar daily emissions (111.94 kgCO2eq and 111.69 kgCO2eq for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively) and costs (74.69 € and 73.05 € for Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively). On the other hand, the use of green energy from the PV panel (Scenario 3) represents the best option for obtaining significant GHGs reduction and economic savings, decreasing both by approximatively 22% in respect to other scenarios, with an annual saving of approximatively 5,916 €. These outcomes suggest that the investment for a second-life BESS, serving a machine such as the ball mill, would imply economic and environmental benefits, as well as advantages from the grid side, enabling load levelling. As a consequence, governments may promote the use of BESS through incentives and, consequently, reducing the payback period.","","978-1-6654-2052-5","10.1109/ICGEA54406.2022.9791901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9791901","second-life battery;battery energy storage system;circular economy;electric vehicle;PV system;load leveling;ball mill machine","Climate change;Renewable energy sources;Greenhouse effect;Green products;Power grids;Batteries;Performance analysis","","4","","22","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We explore several dynamic FOV receiver solutions including steerable (SDFOV) and non-steerable (DFOV) to optimize performance for multiple devices experiencing orientation dynamics. We compare their performance to a baseline fixed FOV receiver (FFOV). Through modeling and simulation we find that SDFOV receivers outperform DFOV by up to 2.6x and FFOV by up to 5.6x in terms of average minimum throughput gain using our test scenario. Similarly, DFOV receivers can achieve up to 2.2x gain over FFOV receivers. For multi-user environments, we compare the performance of coordinated versus distributed system control. Results show that in the worst case, the distributed greedy system performs on average 46%, 16%, and 57% below the coordinated system for SDFOV, DFOV, and FFOV, respectively at a reduced computational complexity compared to the centralized system. We also note that the performance gap in each system diminishes with increasing transmitter Lambertian order. This analysis is done under different room coverage achieved through optimizing the transmitted power to jointly maximize the minimum received power and the standard illuminance range probability at the working plane. Next, we show the impact of self- and random-human blockage at different Lambertian orders on the minimum and average user throughput values. Lastly, we show the gains from employing the hybrid RF/VLC network compared to a VLC-only mode for two different strategies: (1) minimum-throughput-enhancing and (2) sum-throughput-enhancing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3045929","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1617924); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9300130","Visible light communications (VLC);LiFi;dense networks;optical wireless communications (OWC);hybrid RF/VLC;dynamic field of view (FOV);multi-user;interference;self-blockage;user association;random orientation;FOV optimization;resource allocation;load balancing;user association;emission pattern;smart lighting","Receivers;Interference;Transmitters;Optimization;Lighting;Optical transmitters;Throughput","","10","","42","CCBYNCND","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this sense, the transport sector is among the main causes for both emissions and the depletion of non-renewable resources. Considering this scenario, there is an appeal to build more accessible, smart, sustainable and energy-efficient cities, promoting energy transition in urban systems and increasing the quality of urban life. This review aims to analyse transport and urban mobility studies that employ optimisation techniques to achieve environmental-related, sustainability, energy transition or climate change mitigation goals. After an overview regarding modelling aspects of how such goals were addressed, the nature of the objective functions, the perspectives considered, and the network application, such studies were classified into five areas and further detailed. The areas comprise: (i) planning and policy-making; (ii) environmental variables; (iii) demand and traffic management; (iv) technology and energy; and (v) non-spatial measures. In this sense, future research directions should include optimisation models that consider the social aspects of transport and the interests of passengers, operators, and the community simultaneously, improve the modelling of environmental impacts to increase its robustness, and deal with large network problems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3393470","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)(grant numbers:57645446); Coordenação de Aperfei˜coamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES)(grant numbers:88887.682401/2022-00); São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(grant numbers:2023/00182-3); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(grant numbers:406453/2021-7,305215/2022-1); Open Access Publication Fund of University of Duisburg-Essen; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10508372","Climate change;greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;optimising;passenger urban transport;sustainable mobility","Climate change;Greenhouse gases;Optimization methods;Public transportation;Sustainable development;Environmental monitoring;Surveys;Urban areas;Public policy;Energy management;Energy efficiency;Renewable energy sources;Urban planning","","","","201","CCBY","25 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The INDCs of the selected GMS countries set the total GHG emissions reduction target in the range of 117 to 339 Mt-CO2eq by 2030 when compared to the business-as-usual case. The GHG emissions in the INDCs are expected to be reduced through many measures in the energy sector such as efficiency improvement and renewable energy and other measures in the non-energy sector. However, among the four countries only Thailand has certain NDC roadmap for the target in 2030 while others do not have. This matter raises uncertainty on the amount of GHG emissions that can be reduced in the four countries in the INDC timeline. This study estimates the potential of the renewable energy in mitigating the GHG emissions in the selected GMS countries to see how much emissions can be cut down in view of the INDCs by using the Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) model. The paper developed two scenarios namely, Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and Renewable Energy Integration (REI) scenario which follows the energy policies related to renewable energy of each country. The results of the modeling indicate that by 2030 the GHG emissions in the selected GMS countries would be reduced by around 249.2 Mt-CO2eq in the renewable energy scenario. Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam would reduce their GHG emissions by 8.1 Mt-CO2eq, 4.8 Mt-CO2eq, 152.6 Mt-CO2eq, and 83.7 Mt-CO2eq respectively by 2030. The results point out that renewable energy has strong potential to achieve NDC targets.","","978-1-7281-8334-3","10.1109/ICUE49301.2020.9307068","Thammasat University; Stockholm Environment Institute; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307068","Greater Mekong Subregion Countries;Green-house Gas mitigation;LEAP model;Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs);Renewable energy","Renewable energy sources;Climate change;Biomass;Greenhouse effect;Hydroelectric power generation;Planning;Manufacturing industries","","1","","43","IEEE","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the inadequate PEV charging infrastructure may hinder the further adoption of PEVs in the large-scale traffic network, which calls for effective planning solutions for the charging station (CS) placement. The deployment of charging infrastructure inevitably increases the load on the associated power distribution network. Therefore, we are motivated to develop a comprehensive multi-objective framework for optimal CS placement in a traffic network overlaid by a distribution network, considering multiple stakeholders' interested factors, such as traffic flow, PEV charging time cost, PEV travel distance, and the reliability of the distribution network. We leverage a cross-entropy-based method to solve the optimal CS placement and evaluate our method in a real-world 183-node traffic network in Chengdu, China, overlaid by a 26-region distribution network. It is demonstrated that our work provides various viable planning options favoring different objectives for the stakeholders' decision-making in practice.","","979-8-3503-3934-5","10.1109/ICPSAsia58343.2023.10294653","Australian Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10294653","Electric vehicle;charging infrastructure planning;multi-objective optimization;cross-entropy method","Costs;Simulation;Decision making;Distribution networks;Minimization;Planning;Power systems;Climate change;Electric vehicles;Entropy","","2","","17","IEEE","3 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a novel intelligent optimization based demand-side management (DSM) framework for smart grid integrated with RESs. In the intelligent DSM framework the artificial neural network (ANN) forecasts energy usage behavior of consumers and real-time price-based demand response program (RTPDRP) of electric utility company (EUC). The smart energy management controller of the proposed intelligent DSM framework adapts forecasted energy usage behavior of consumers using forecasted RTPDRP to create operation schedule. The consumers implement the created schedule to minimize energy cost, peak load, carbon emission subjected to improving user comfort and avoiding rebound peaks. Simulations are conducted using our proposed hybrid genetic ant colony (HGAC) optimization algorithm to create schedule for three cases: EUC without RESs, EUC with RESs, and EUC with both RESs and storage technologies. To endorse the applicability and productivity of the proposed DSM framework based on HGAC optimization algorithm with five existing algorithms based frameworks. Simulation results show that the proposed DSM framework is superior compared with the existing frameworks in terms of energy cost minimization, peak load mitigation, carbon emission alleviation, and user discomfort minimization. The proposed HGAC optimization algorithm reduced electricity cost, carbon emission, and peak load by 12.16%, 4.00%, and 19.44% in case I; by 26.8%, 20.71%, and 33.3% in case II; and by 24.4%, 16.44%, and 37.08% in case III, respectively, compared to without scheduling.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3109136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525393","Demand-side management;battery energy storage systems;photovoltaic;demand response;scheduling;smart grid","Optimization;Peak to average power ratio;Energy consumption;Home appliances;Carbon dioxide;Smart grids;Minimization","","24","","43","CCBY","30 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Majority of the energy requirement of the Indian economy is been accounted by imported fossil fuel. Contribution of renewable energy resources is very less in the total energy requirement. Solar energy is one of the better alternate energy source to fulfill the needs of Indian energy requirement as geographically it is near the equator. Indian government has come up with many policies and initiatives to increase the footprint of solar energy there by reducing the carbon foot print. The current study investigates the impact of Indian government policies and initiatives taken to mitigate the green gas emission for a sustainable development in India. The analysis shows that there is a steep increase in production of solar energy as a source of renewable energy in India. But the amount of green gas emission is more due to the rapid industrial growth in India. So Government of India must take more steps to popularize the use of solar energy as an alternate energy sources in the sub-continent to reduce the green gas emission for a sustainable development.","","978-1-6654-6275-4","10.1109/ICPECTS56089.2022.10046744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10046744","Green Gas;Solar energy;carbon footprints;renewable energy","Industries;Renewable energy sources;Green products;Transportation;Solar energy;Carbon dioxide;Climate change;Solar energy;Economics;Energy management","","5","","15","IEEE","27 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was found that a significant amount of energy is lost with the exhaust gases, which are released to the atmosphere. The amount was up to 74.6%, which is wasteful, polluting and unsustainable. Analysis on possible conversion from the open cycle to combined cycle plant demonstrated that subject to practical limitations, specific fuel consumption reduces by 22% and power output increases by 11.69 MW, which is 38% increase from the Rankine cycle turbine.
